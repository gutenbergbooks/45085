<p class="center b2">1648&ndash;1656 <span class="smcap smaller">C. E.</span></p>

<p>Poland ceased to be a haven for the sons of Judah,
when its short-sighted kings summoned the Jesuits
to supervise the training of the young nobles and
the clergy and crush the spirit of the Polish dissidents.
These originators of disunion, to whom
the frequent partition of Poland must be attributed,
sought to undermine the unobtrusive power which
the Jews, through their money and prudence,
exercised over the nobles, and they combined with
their other foes, German workmen and trades-people,
members of the guilds, to restrict and
oppress them. After that time there were repeated
persecutions of Jews in Poland; sometimes the
German guild members, sometimes the disciples of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_2" id="Page_2">2</a></span>
the Jesuits, raised a hue and cry against them.
Still, in the calamities of the Thirty Years' War,
fugitive Jews sought Poland, because the canonical
laws against Jews were not applied there with strictness.
The high nobility continued to be dependent
on Jews, who in a measure counterbalanced the
national defects. Polish flightiness, levity, unsteadiness,
extravagance, and recklessness were compensated
for by Jewish prudence, sagacity, economy,
and cautiousness. The Jew was more than a financier
to the Polish nobleman; he was his help in
embarrassment, his prudent adviser, his all-in-all.
Especially did the nobility make use of Jews in developing
recently established colonies, for which
they had neither the necessary perseverance nor
the ability. Colonies had gradually been formed on
the lower Dnieper and the northern shore of the
Black Sea, by runaway Polish serfs, criminals, adventurers
from every province, peasants, and nobles,
who felt themselves cramped and endangered in
their homes. These outcasts formed the root of the
Cossack race at the waterfalls of the Dnieper
(Za-Porogi), whence the Cossacks obtained the name
of Zaporogians. To maintain themselves, they took
to plundering the neighboring Tartars. They became
inured to war, and with every success their
courage and independent spirit increased.</p>

<p>The kings, who needed the Cossacks in military
undertakings and to ward off the inroads of Tartars
and Turks, granted them some independence in the
Ukraine and Little Russia, and appointed a chieftain
over them from their own midst, an Attaman,
or Hetman, with special marks of dignity. But the
bigoted temper of King Sigismund III and the
Jesuits made the Cossacks, who might have become
an element of strength for Poland, the source of
endless discontent and rebellion. The Zaporogians
for the most part were adherents of the Greek
Church, the Greek Catholic confession being predominant<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_3" id="Page_3">3</a></span>
in southern Poland. After the popes
by means of the Jesuits had weakened and oppressed
the Polish dissidents, they labored to unite the
Greek Catholics with the Romish Church or to extirpate
them. With the warlike spirit of the Cossacks
this change was not easy; hence a regular
system of enslavement was employed against them.
Three noble houses, the Koniecpolski, Vishnioviecki,
and Potocki, had control of colonization in the
Ukraine and Little Russia, and they transferred to
their Jewish business agents the farming of the
oppressive imposts falling on the Cossacks. Thus
Jewish communities gradually spread in the Ukraine,
Little Russia, and even beyond these provinces.
The Cossacks, for instance, had to pay a tax at the
birth of a child and on every marriage. That there
might be no evasion, the Jewish revenue farmers
had the keys of the Greek churches, and when the
clergyman wished to perform a baptism or a marriage,
he was obliged to ask them for the key. In
general, the position of the Jews in districts where
none but Poles dwelt was better than in those which
besides Polish inhabitants contained a German population,
as was the case in the large cities, Posen,
Cracow, Lublin, and Lemberg.</p>

<p>By reason of their great number, their importance,
and their compact union, the Jews in Poland
formed a state within a state. The general
synod, which assembled twice a year at Lublin and
Jaroslaw, formed a legislative and judicial parliament
from which there was no appeal. At first
called the Synod of the Three Countries, it became
in the first quarter of the seventeenth century the
Synod of the Four Countries (Vaad Arba Arazoth).
An elective president (Parnes di Arba Arazoth)
was at the head, and conducted public affairs. The
communities and rabbis had civil, and, to a certain
extent, criminal, jurisdiction, at least against informers
and traitors. Hence no Jew ventured to bring<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_4" id="Page_4">4</a></span>
an accusation against one of his race before the authorities
of the country, fearing to expose himself
to disgrace and contempt from public opinion, which
would have embittered his life, or even entailed
death. Almost every community had its college of
judges, a rabbi with two assessors, before whom
every complaint was brought, but the final decision
rested with the synod. The synod also concerned
itself about honesty in dealing and conduct,
and in weight and measure, wherever Jews were
affected.</p>

<p>The study of the Talmud in Poland, established
by Shachna, Solomon Lurya, and Moses Isserles,
reached a pitch attained at no previous time, nor in
any other country. The demand for copies of the
Talmud was so great that in less than twenty years
three editions had to be printed, no doubt in thousands
of copies. The study of the Talmud was a
greater necessity in Poland than in the rest of
Europe. The rabbis, as has been already said, had
jurisdiction of their own, and decided according to
Talmudical and Rabbinical laws. The great number
of Jews in Poland, and their fondness for litigation,
gave occasion to intricate law cases. The
rabbi-judges were obliged to go back to the
source of law, the Talmud, to seek points of support
for such cases. The contending parties being
themselves well informed and acute, the reasoning
of the rabbis had to be flawless to escape criticism.
Hence Rabbinical civil law in Poland met with extraordinary
cultivation and extension, to adapt it to all
cases and make it available for the learned litigants.
Thus the ever-growing subtlety of the
method of Talmud study depended on current conditions
and wants, and on the circumstance that each
Talmudist wished to surpass all others in ingenuity.</p>

<p>It would be tedious to enumerate the Rabbinical
authors of Poland in the first half of the seventeenth
century. The cultivation of a single faculty, that of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_5" id="Page_5">5</a></span>
hair-splitting judgment, at the cost of the rest, narrowed
the imagination, hence not a single literary
product appeared in Poland deserving the name of
poetry. All the productions of the Polish school
bore the Talmudical stamp, as the school regarded
everything from the Talmudical point of view. The
disciples of this school looked down almost with
contempt on Scripture and its simple grandeur, or
rather it did not exist for them. How, indeed,
could they have found time to occupy themselves
with it? And what could they do with these children's
stories, which did not admit the application
of intellectual subtlety? They knew something of
the Bible from the extracts read in the synagogues,
and those occasionally quoted in the Talmud. The
faculty for appreciating the sublimity of biblical doctrines
and characters, as well as simplicity and elevation
in general, was denied them. A love of
twisting, distorting, ingenious quibbling, and a foregone
antipathy to what did not lie within their field
of vision, constituted the character of the Polish
Jews. Pride in their knowledge of the Talmud and
a spirit of dogmatism attached even to the best
rabbis, and undermined their moral sense. The
Polish Jews of course were extraordinarily pious, but
even their piety rested on sophistry and boastfulness.
Each wished to surpass the other in knowledge
of what the Code prescribed for one case or
another. Thus religion sank, not merely, as among
Jews of other countries, to a mechanical, unintelligent
ceremonial, but to a subtle art of interpretation.
To know better was everything to them; but
to act according to acknowledged principles of religious
purity, and exemplify them in a moral life,
occurred to but few. Integrity and right-mindedness
they had lost as completely as simplicity and
the sense of truth. The vulgar acquired the quibbling
method of the schools, and employed it to
outwit the less cunning. They found pleasure and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_6" id="Page_6">6</a></span>
a sort of triumphant delight in deception and cheating.
Against members of their own race cunning
could not well be employed, because they were
sharp-witted; but the non-Jewish world with which
they came into contact experienced to its disadvantage
the superiority of the Talmudical spirit of the
Polish Jews. The Polish sons of the Talmud paid
little attention to the fact, that the Talmud and the
great teachers of Judaism object even more strongly
to taking advantage of members of a different faith
than of those of their own race.</p>

<p>The corruption of the Polish Jews was avenged
upon them in a terrible way, and the result was,
that the rest of the Jews in Europe were for a time
infected with it. With fatal blindness Polish Jews
offered the nobility and the Jesuits a helping hand
in oppressing the Zaporogian Cossacks in the
Ukraine and Little Russia. The magnates wished
to make profitable serfs of the Cossacks, the Jesuits
hoped to convert the Greek heretics into Roman
Catholics, the Jews settled in the district expected
to enrich themselves and play the lord over these
pariahs. They advised the possessors of the Cossack
colonies how most completely to humiliate, oppress,
torment, and ill-use them; they usurped the
office of judges over them, and vexed them in their
ecclesiastical affairs. No wonder that the enslaved
Cossacks hated the Jews, with whom their relations
were closest, almost more than their noble and
clerical foes. The Jews were not without warning
what would be their lot, if these embittered enemies
once got the upper hand. In an insurrection of the
Zaporogians under their Hetman in about 1638,
despite its brief duration, they slew 200 Jews, and
destroyed several synagogues. Nevertheless, Jews
lent a hand, when in consequence of the insurrection
the further enslavement of the sufferers was
determined upon. In the year 1648, fixed by that
lying book, the Zohar, they expected the coming of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_7" id="Page_7">7</a></span>
the Messiah and the time of redemption, when they
would be in power, and, therefore, they were more
reckless and careless than was their custom at other
times. Bloody retribution was not long delayed,
and struck the innocent with the guilty, perhaps the
former more severely than the latter.</p>

<p>It proceeded from a man who understood how to
make use of the increasing hatred of the Cossacks
for his purposes, and who was regarded by his
countrymen as their ideal. Bogdan Chmielnicki
(Russian Chmel), born about 1595, died 1657, before
whom all Poland trembled for several years,
gave Russia the first opportunity of interfering in
the Polish republic, and was a frightful scourge for
the Jews. Chmielnicki, brave in war and artful in
the execution of his plans, impenetrable in his
schemes, at once cruel and hypocritical, had been
vexed by Jews, when he held the subordinate position
of camp secretary (Pisar) of the Cossacks subject
to the house of Koniecpolski. A Jew, Zachariah
Sabilenki, had played him a trick, by which he
was robbed of his wife and property. Another had
betrayed him when he had come to an understanding
with the Tartars. Besides injuries which his
race had sustained from Jewish tax farmers in the
Ukraine, he, therefore, had personal wrongs to
avenge. His remark to the Cossacks, "The Poles
have delivered us as slaves to the cursed breed
of Jews," was enough to excite them. Vengeance-breathing
Zaporogians and booty-loving Tartars
in a short time put the Polish troops to flight
by successful man&oelig;uvres (May 18, 1648). Potocki,
the lieutenant-general, and 8,000 Poles, according
to agreement, were delivered to the Tartars. After
the victory the wild troops went eastward from the
Dnieper, between Kiev and Pultava, plundering
and murdering, especially the Jews who had not
taken flight; the number of the murdered reached
several thousand. Hundreds underwent baptism<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_8" id="Page_8">8</a></span>
in the Greek Church, and pretended to be Christians,
in order to save themselves. Fortunate were
those who fell into captivity with the Tartars; they
were transported to the Crimea, and ransomed by
Turkish Jews. Four Jewish communities (Porobischa
and others) of about 3,000 souls resolved to escape
massacre by surrendering to the Tartars with all
their property. They were well treated, and sold
into Turkey, where they were ransomed in a brotherly
manner by those of their own race. The Constantinople
community sent a deputy to Holland to
collect money from the rich communities for the
ransom of captives.</p>

<p>Unfortunately for the Poles and Jews, King
Vladislav, for whom Chmielnicki had shown some
respect, was removed by death. During the inter-regnum
of several months, from May to October,
1648, the usual Polish dissension occurred, which
crippled every attempt at resistance. At first
Chmielnicki drew back, apparently inclined to negotiate
with the crown, but he gave his creatures
full power to ravage the Polish provinces. Regular
troops of murderers, called Haidamaks (the Tartar
word for partisans), were formed under brutal
leaders who cared not a straw for human life, and
who reveled in the death-struggles of their Polish
and Jewish foes. In the name of religion they were
urged by the Greek popes to murder Catholics and
Jews. The commander of each troop had his own
method of exercising cruelty. One had thongs
slung round the necks of Catholic and Jewish
women, by which they were dragged along; this he
called "presenting them with a red ribbon." A few
weeks after the first victory of the Cossacks, a
troop under another of these chiefs advanced
against the stronghold of Nemirov, where 6,000
Jews, inhabitants and fugitives from the neighborhood,
had assembled; they were in possession of
the fortress, and closed the gates. But the Cossacks<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_9" id="Page_9">9</a></span>
had an understanding with the Greek Christians
in the town, and put on Polish uniforms in
order to be taken for Poles. The Christian inhabitants
urged the Jews to open the gates for their
friends. They did so, and were suddenly attacked
by the Cossacks and the inhabitants of the town,
and almost entirely cut down amid frightful tortures
(Siwan 20&mdash;June 10, 1648).</p>

<p>Another Haidamak troop under Kryvonoss attacked
the town of Tulczyn, where about 600 Christians
and 2,000 Jews had taken refuge in the fortress.
There were brave Jews among them, or
necessity had made them brave, and they would not
die without resistance. Nobles and Jews swore to
defend the town and fortress to the last man. As
the Cossack peasants understood nothing of the art
of siege, and had repeatedly suffered severely from
the sorties of Jews and Poles, they resorted to a
trick. They assured the nobles that their rage was
directed only against the Jews, their deadly foes; if
these were delivered up, they would withdraw. The
infatuated nobles, forgetful of their oath, proposed
that the Jews should deliver up their arms to them.
The Jews at first thought of turning on the Poles
for their treachery, as they exceeded them in numbers.
But the rabbi of Tulczyn warned them
against attacking the Poles, who would inflict bloody
vengeance, and all Poland would be excited against
the Jews, who would be exterminated. He implored
them to sacrifice themselves for their brethren in
the whole country; perhaps the Cossacks would
accept their property as ransom. The Jews consented,
and delivered up their arms, the Poles thereupon
admitting the troops into the town. After the
latter had taken everything from the Jews, they set
before them the choice of death or baptism. Not
one of them would purchase life at that price; about
1,500 were tortured and executed before the eyes
of the Polish nobles (Tamuz 4&mdash;June 24). The<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_10" id="Page_10">10</a></span>
Cossacks left ten rabbis alive, in order to extort
large sums from the communities. The Poles were
immediately punished for their treachery. Deprived
of the assistance of the Jews, they were attacked
by the Cossacks and slain, proving that violators of
their word cannot reckon on fidelity towards themselves.
This sad event had the good effect that the
Poles always sided with the Jews, and were not opposed
to them in the course of the long war.</p>

<p>At the same time another Haidamak troop, under
a leader named Hodki, had penetrated into Little
Russia, and caused dreadful slaughter in the communities
of Homel, Starodub, Czernigov, and other
places east and north of Kiev. The Jews of Homel
are said to have suffered martyrdom most firmly,
on the same day on which the Tulczyn community
was annihilated. The leader of the troop had
all the Jews of Homel, inhabitants as well as fugitives,
stripped outside the town, and surrounded by
Cossacks, and called upon them to be baptized or
to expect a most frightful death. They all, men,
women, and children, to the number of about 1,500,
preferred death.</p>

<p>Prince Vishnioviecki, the only heroic figure
amongst the Poles at that time, a man of penetration,
intrepid courage, and strategic ability, defended
the cause of the persecuted Jews with devoted zeal.
He took the fugitives under the protecting wings of
his small, but brave force, with which he everywhere
pursued the Cossack bands to destruction. But,
because of his limited power, he could accomplish
nothing of lasting import. Through petty jealousy,
he was passed over at the election of the commander-in-chief
against the Cossack insurrection,
and instead of him three were chosen, of a character
calculated to help on Chmielnicki to further victories.</p>

<p>Annoyed at the pitiful policy of the regent, the
primate of Gnesen, Vishnioviecki followed his own
course, but was compelled to retreat before the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_11" id="Page_11">11</a></span>
overpowering number of the roving troops and the
Greek Catholic population in sympathy with them,
and so destruction was brought on the Jews, who
had reckoned on his heroic courage. In the fortress
of Polonnoie, between Zaslav and Zytomir, 10,000
Jews, partly inhabitants, partly fugitives from the
neighborhood, are said to have perished at the hand
of the besieging Haidamaks and the traitorous inhabitants
(Ab 13&mdash;July 22).</p>

<p>The unfortunate issue of the second war between
Poles and Cossacks (September, 1648), when the
Polish army, more through dread of the Tartars
under Tuga√Ø Bey and the incapacity of its generals,
than through Chmielnicki's bravery, was scattered
in wild flight, and collected only behind the walls of
Lemberg, prepared a bloody fate even for Jews who
thought themselves safe at a distance from the field
of battle. There was no escape from the wild assaults
of the Zaporogians, unless they could reach
the Wallachian borders. The blood of slaughtered
and maltreated Jews marked the vast tract from the
southern part of the Ukraine to Lemberg by way of
Dubno and Brody; in the town of Bar alone from
two to three thousand perished. It scarcely need
be said that the brutal cruelty of the regular Cossacks,
as well as of the wild Haidamaks, made no
distinction between Rabbanites and Karaites. The
important community of Lemberg lost many of its
members through hunger and pestilence, and its
property besides, which it had to pay to the Cossacks
as ransom.</p>

<p>In the town of Narol the Zaporogians caused a
revolting butchery. It is said that in the beginning
of November 45,000 persons, among them 12,000
Jews, were slain there with the cruellest tortures.
Among the corpses remained living women and
children, who for several days had to feed on human
flesh. Meanwhile the Haidamaks roamed about in
Volhynia, Podolia, and West Russia, and slaked<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_12" id="Page_12">12</a></span>
their revenge in the blood of nobles, Catholics,
clergy, and Jews, to thousands and tens of thousands.
In Crzemieniec an inhuman monster slew
hundreds of Jewish children, scornfully examined
the corpses as Jews do with cattle, and threw them
to the dogs. In many towns Jews, as well as Catholics,
armed themselves, and drove the bloodthirsty
Cossacks away.</p>

<p>The election of a king, which finally was effected&mdash;and,
though the Polish state was on the brink of an
abyss, it took place amidst fights and commotions&mdash;put
an end to bloodshed for the moment. Although
for the most part in a drunken condition, Chmielnicki
retained sobriety enough to dictate, among
his conditions of peace, that no Catholic church
should be tolerated, nor any Jew live, in the Cossack
provinces. The commission, unable to accept
the conditions, departed without settling the business
(February 16, 1649). The Jews, who had
reckoned upon a settlement, and returned to their
home, paid for their confidence with death, for the
Cossacks surrounded the towns with death-cries.
Thus, a second time, many Jews and nobles perished
at Ostrog (March 4, 1649).</p>

<p>The breaking off of the negotiation with Chmielnicki
led to a third encounter. Although the Polish
army this time appeared better armed on the field of
battle, it had as little success as before. In the battle
at Sbar√°z it would have been completely destroyed by
the Zaporogians and Tartars, if the king had not
wisely come to an understanding with the Tartar
chief. Thereupon followed the peace (August,
1649), which confirmed Chmielnicki's programme,
among other points that concerning the Jews. In
the chief seats of the Cossacks (<i>i. e.</i>, in the Ukraine,
West Russia, in the district of Kiev, and a part of
Podolia) they could neither own or rent landed
estates, nor live there.</p>

<p>In consequence of this convention, the Poles and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_13" id="Page_13">13</a></span>
Jews were unmolested for about a year and a half,
although on both sides schemes were harbored to
break the agreement at the first opportunity. As
far as residence was allowed them, the fugitive Jews
returned to their homes. King John Casimir allowed
the Jews baptized according to the Greek confession
openly to profess Judaism. In consequence, the
baptized Jews fled from the Catholic districts to
Poland to be free from compulsory Christianity.
This permission was especially used by Jewish
women whom the rude Zaporogians had married.
The Jews brought back into Judaism many hundreds
of children, who had lost their parents and relatives,
and had been brought up in Christianity, investigated
their descent, and hung the indication of it in a small
roll round their necks, that they might not marry
blood relations of forbidden degrees. The general
synod of rabbis and leaders which assembled at
Lublin in 1650 occupied itself entirely with the
attempt to heal, at least partially, the wounds of
Judaism. Many hundreds, even thousands, of Jewish
women did not know whether their husbands
lay in the grave, or were begging in the East or
West, in Turkey or Germany, whether they were
widows or wives, or they found themselves in other
perplexities created by the Rabbinical law. The
synod of Lublin is said to have hit upon excellent
arrangements. Most probably the lenient Lipmann
Heller, then rabbi of Cracow, strove to effect a
mild interpretation of the law relating to supposed
death. At the instigation of the young, genial
rabbi Sabbata√Ø Cohen (Shach), the day of the first
massacre at Nemirov (Siwan 20) was appointed as
a general fast day for the remnant of the Polish
community. The hoary Lipmann Heller, at Cracow,
Sabbata√Ø Hurwitz, at Posen, and the young Sabbata√Ø
Cohen drew up penitential prayers (Selichoth),
mostly selected from older pieces, for this sad memorial
day.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_14" id="Page_14">14</a></span>
After a pause of a year and a half, the war
between Cossacks and Poles broke out in the
early part of the year 1651, the first victims again
being Jews, as Chmielnicki and the wild Zaporogians
now fell upon the Polish territory where Jewish
communities had again settled. The massacre,
however, could not be so extensive as before; there
no longer were thousands of Jews to slaughter.
Moreover the evil days had inspired the Jews with
courage; they armed a troop of Jewish soldiers, and
enlisted them in the king's service. The fortune of
war turned against the Cossacks, and they were
obliged to accept the peace dictated by the king
(November 11, 1651). John Casimir and his ministers
did not forget to guard the rights of the Jews
in the treaty. They were to be permitted to settle
anywhere in the Ukraine, and to hold property on
lease.</p>

<p>This treaty also was concluded and ratified only
to be broken. Chmielnicki had accepted it to
strengthen himself and restore his reputation with
the Cossacks. As soon as he had gained his first
object, he began hostilities against the Poles, from
which Jews always suffered most severely. In two
years after the first insurrection of the Zaporogians,
more than 300 communities were completely destroyed
by death or flight, and the end of
their suffering had not yet arrived. The Polish
troops could not withstand the violent attacks
or skillful policy of Chmielnicki. When he could no
longer hope for help from the Tartars, he combined
with the Russians, and incited them to a war against
unhappy Poland, divided against itself. In consequence
of the Russian war in the early part of 1654
and 1655, those communities suffered which had
been spared by the Cossack swarms, <i>i. e.</i>, the western
districts and Lithuania. The community of Wilna,
one of the largest, was completely depopulated (July,
1655) by slaughter on the part of the Russians and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_15" id="Page_15">15</a></span>
by migration. As if fate were then determining
upon the partition of Poland, a new enemy was
added to the Cossacks and Russians in Charles X
of Sweden, who used Poland as the first available
pretext to slake his thirst for war. Through the
Swedish war, the communities of Great and Little
Poland, from Posen to Cracow, were reduced to
want and despair. The Jews of Poland had to drink
the cup of poison to the dregs. The Polish general,
Czarnicki, who hated the Jews, ill-used those spared
by Cossacks, Russians, and the wild Swedes of the
Thirty Years' War, under the pretense that they
had a traitorous understanding with the Swedes. The
Poles also behaved barbarously to the Jews, destroyed
the synagogues, and tore up the holy scriptures.
All Poland was like a bloody field of battle, on which
Cossacks, Russians, Prussians, Swedes, and the
troops of Prince Ragoczi of Transylvania wrestled;
the Jews were ill-used or slain by all. Only the
Great Elector of Brandenburg behaved leniently towards
them. The number of Jewish families said to
have perished in ten years of this war (600,000) is
certainly exaggerated, but the slaughtered Jews of
Poland may well be rated at a quarter of a million.
With the decline of Poland as a power of the first
rank, the importance of Polish Judaism diminished.
The remnant were impoverished, depressed, and
could not recover their former position. Their
need was so great, that those who drifted to the
neighborhood of Prussia hired themselves to Christians
as day laborers for field work.</p>

<p>As at the time of the expulsion of the Jews from
Spain and Portugal every place was filled with
fugitive Sephardic Jews, so during the Cossack-Polish
war fugitive Polish Jews, wretched in appearance,
with hollow eyes, who had escaped the sword,
the flames, hunger, and pestilence; or who,
dragged by the Tartars into captivity, had
been ransomed by their brethren, were seeking<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_16" id="Page_16">16</a></span>
shelter everywhere. Westwards, by way of
Dantzic and through the Vistula district, Jewish-Polish
fugitives wandered to Amsterdam, and were
forwarded thence to Frankfort-on-the-Main and
other Rhenish cities. Three thousand Lithuanian
Jews came to Texel in the Netherlands, and were hospitably
received. Southwards many fled to Moravia,
Bohemia, Austria, and Hungary, and wandered
from those places to Italy. The prisoners
in the armies of the Tartars came to the Turkish
provinces, and some of them drifted to
Barbary. Everywhere they were received by their
brethren with great cordiality and love, cared for,
clothed, and supported. The Italian Jews ransomed
and supported them at great sacrifice. Thus, the
community of Leghorn at this time formed a resolution
to collect and spend a quarter of their income
for the liberation and maintenance of the unfortunate
Polish Jews. The German and Austrian communities,
also, although they had suffered under the
calamities of the Thirty Years' War, exercised that
brotherly feeling which they rarely professed with
their lips, but cherished the more deeply in their
hearts.</p>

<p>The number and misery of those escaped from
Poland were so great, that the German communities
and probably others were obliged to devote the
money intended for Jerusalem to the maintenance
of Polish Jews. The Jews of Jerusalem dependent
on alms, who were drained by the pasha and his
subordinates, felt the want of their regular support
from Europe. They soon fell into such distress,
that of the 700 widows and a smaller number of
men living there nearly 400 are said to have died
of hunger.</p>

<p>The Cossack persecution of the Jews, in a sense,
remodeled Judaism. It became Polonized, so to
speak. The Polish-Rabbinical method of study had
long dominated the Talmudical schools of Germany<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_17" id="Page_17">17</a></span>
and Italy through the abundant literature by Polish
authors. Now, through the fugitives, most of whom
were Talmudical scholars, it became authoritative.
Rabbinical appointments were mostly conferred on
Polish Talmudists, as in Moravia, Amsterdam,
F√ºrth, Frankfort, and Metz. On account of their
superiority in their department, these Polish Talmudists
were as proud as the Spanish and Portuguese
fugitives had been, and looked down with
contempt on the rabbis who spoke German, Portuguese,
and Italian. Far from giving up their own
method in a foreign country, they demanded that
all the world should be regulated by them, and they
gained their point. People joked about the "Polacks,"
but nevertheless became subordinate to
them. Whoever wished to acquire thorough Talmudic
and Rabbinical knowledge was obliged to sit
at the feet of Polish rabbis; every father of a family
who wished to educate his children in the Talmud
sought a Polish rabbi for them. These Polish rabbis
gradually forced their sophistical piety upon the
German, and partly on the Portuguese, and Italian,
communities. Through their influence, scientific
knowledge and the study of the Bible declined still
more than previously. In the century of Descartes
and Spinoza, when the three Christian nations, the
French, English, and Dutch, gave the death-blow to
the Middle Ages, Jewish-Polish emigrants, baited
by Chmielnicki's bands, brought a new middle age
over European Judaism, which maintained itself in
full vigor for more than a century, to some extent
lasting to our time.</p>

<p class="center b2">1655&ndash;1657 <span class="smcap smaller">C. E.</span></p>

<p>At the very time when the Jews of Poland were
trodden down, slaughtered, or driven through
Europe like terrified wild beasts, a land of freedom
was opened, from which the Jews had been banished
for more than three centuries and a half. England,
which the wise queen Elizabeth and the brave Cromwell
had raised to be the first power in Europe, a
position very different from that of crumbling
Poland, again admitted Jews, not indeed through
the great portal, yet through the back door. But
this admission was so bruited abroad, that it was
like a triumph for Judaism. The Jews of Amsterdam
and Hamburg looked with longing to this
island, to which they were so near, with whose merchants,
shipowners, and scholars they were in connection,
and which promised wide scope for the
exercise of their varied abilities. But settlement
there seemed beset with insuperable obstacles. The
English episcopal church, which exercised sway over<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_19" id="Page_19">19</a></span>
the English conscience, was even more intolerant
than the popery which it persecuted. Not granting
freedom to Catholics and Dissenters, would it tolerate
the descendants of those aspersed in the New
Testament? The English people, who for centuries
had seen no Jew, shared to the full the
antipathy of the clergy. To them every Jew was a
Shylock, who, with hearty goodwill, would cut a
Christian to pieces&mdash;a monster in human form, bearing
the mark of Cain. Who would undertake to
banish this strong prejudice in order to render
people and rulers favorable to the descendants of
Israel?</p>

<p>The man who undertook and executed this difficult
task did not belong to the first rank of intellectual
men, but possessed the right measure of
insight and narrowness, strength of will and flexibility,
knowledge and imagination, self-denial and
vanity, required for so arduous an undertaking.
Manasseh ben Israel, second or third rabbi at
Amsterdam, who at home played only a subordinate
part, the poor preacher who, to support his
family, was obliged to resort to printing, but obtained
so little profit from it, that he wished to
exchange pulpit oratory for mercantile speculation,
and was near settling in Brazil; he it was who won
England for Judaism, and, if he did not banish,
diminished the prejudice against his race. To him
belongs the credit for a service not to be lightly
estimated, for there were but few to help him. The
release of the Jews from their thousand years' contempt
and depreciation in European society, or
rather the struggle for civil equality, begins with
Manasseh ben Israel. He was the Riesser of the
seventeenth century. As has been stated, he was
not in the true sense great, and can only be
reckoned a man of mediocrity. He belonged to the
happily constituted class of persons, who do not
perceive the harsh contrasts and shrill discords in<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_20" id="Page_20">20</a></span>
the world around, hence are confiding and enterprising.
His heart was deeper than his mind. His
power rested in his easy eloquence, his facility in
explaining and working out ideas which lay within
his narrow field of vision, and which he had acquired
rather than produced. Manasseh ben Israel had
complete grasp of Jewish literature, and knew the
Christian theology of his time, and what was to be
said on each point, <i>i. e.</i>, what had been said by his
predecessors. On the other hand, he had only a
superficial knowledge of those branches of learning
which require keenness of intellect, such as philosophy
and the Talmud. His strength was in one
respect his weakness. His facility in speaking and
writing encouraged a verbose style and excessive
productiveness. He left more than 400 sermons in
Portuguese, and a mass of writings that fill a
catalogue, but discuss their subjects only superficially.
Manasseh's contemporaries looked upon
his writings with different eyes. The learning
amassed therein from all literatures and languages,
and the smoothness of form riveted their attention,
and excited their admiration. Among Jews he was
extraordinarily celebrated; whoever could produce
Latin, Portuguese, or Spanish verse, made known
his praise. But even Christian scholars of his time
over-estimated him.</p>

<p>In Holland, which, by the concurrence of many
circumstances, and especially through the powerful
impulse of Joseph Scaliger, the prince of philologists,
had become in a sense the school of Europe, the
foundation was laid in the seventeenth century for
the wonderful learning contained in voluminous
folios. At no time had there been so many philologists
with early-matured learning, iron memory, and
wonderful devotion to the science of language, as in
the first half of the seventeenth century, which
seems to have been specially appointed to revive
what had so long been neglected. All the literary<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_21" id="Page_21">21</a></span>
treasures of antiquity were collected and utilized;
statesmen vied with professional scholars. In this
gigantic collection there was little critical search for
truth; the chief consideration was the number of
scientific facts gathered. The ambition of many was
spurred on to understand the three favored languages
of antiquity&mdash;Greek, Latin, and Hebrew&mdash;and
their literatures. Hebrew, the language of
religion, enjoyed special preference, and whoever
understood it as well as the other two tongues was
sure of distinction. Joseph Scaliger, the oracle of
Dutch and Protestant theology, had given to Rabbinical
literature, so-called, a place in the republic of
letters beside the Hebrew language, and even the
Talmud he treated with a certain amount of respect.
His Dutch, French, and English disciples followed
his example, and devoted themselves with zeal to
this branch of knowledge, formerly regarded with
contempt or even aversion.</p>

<p>John Buxtorf, senior (born 1564, died 1639), of
Basle, may be said to have been master of Hebrew
and Rabbinical literature, and he rendered them
accessible to Christian circles. He carried on a
lively correspondence in Hebrew with Jewish
scholars in Amsterdam, Germany, and Constantinople.
Even ladies devoted themselves to Hebrew
language and literature. That prodigy, Anna Maria
Schurmann, of Utrecht, who knew almost all European
languages and their literature, corresponded in Hebrew
with scholars, and also with an English lady,
Dorothea Moore, and quoted Rashi and Ibn-Ezra
with a scholar's accuracy. The eccentric queen
Christina of Sweden, the learned daughter of Gustavus
Adolphus, understood Hebrew. Statesmen,
such as Hugo Grotius, and the Englishman John
Selden, seriously and deeply engaged in its pursuit
for their theological or historical studies.</p>

<p>But Christian scholars, with all their zeal, had not
yet acquired independence in Rabbinical literature;<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_22" id="Page_22">22</a></span>
without a Jewish guide, they could not move, or felt
unsafe. To Christian inquirers, therefore, Manasseh
ben Israel's treatises, which presented many
Rabbinical passages and new points of view, were
highly welcome. Much of the Talmudic literature
became accessible through his clear exposition.
Hence, Dutch scholars sought out Manasseh,
courted his friendship, fairly hung upon his lips, and
gradually discarded prejudice against Jews, which
even the most liberal-minded men in the most tolerant
country of Europe had not laid aside. Manasseh
was joined particularly by those eager
inquirers who were persecuted or declared heretics
by the ruling church. The learned Vossius family,
even John Gerard Vossius, senior, although filled
with strong hatred against Jews, was affable to
Manasseh. His son, Dionysius Vossius, a prodigy
of learning, snatched away by death in his eighteenth
year, on his death-bed translated into Latin Manasseh's
"Reconciler" (Conciliador) shortly after its
appearance. Isaac Vossius, the youngest son, who
filled an honorable office under the queen of Sweden,
recommended Manasseh ben Israel to her. By this
family he was made acquainted with the learned
statesman Hugo Grotius, who also received instruction
from him. The chief of the Arminians,
Simon Episcopius, sought intercourse with Manasseh,
as did Caspar Barl√¶us, who as a Socinian,
<i>i. e.</i>, a denier of the Trinity, was avoided by orthodox
Christians. He attached himself to Manasseh, and
sang his praise in Latin verses, on which account he
was attacked yet more violently, because he had put
the Jewish faith on an equality with the Christian.
The learned Jesuit Peter Daniel Huet also cultivated
his friendship. Gradually the Chacham and
preacher of Amsterdam acquired such a reputation
among Christians, that every scholar traveling
through that city sought him out as an extraordinary
personage. Foreigners exchanged letters<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_23" id="Page_23">23</a></span>
with him, and obtained from him explanations on
difficult points. Manasseh had an interview with
Queen Christina of Sweden, which stimulated her
kindness for the Jews, and her liking for Jewish
literature. So highly did many Christians rate
Manasseh ben Israel, that they could not suppress
the wish to see so learned and excellent a rabbi
won over to Christianity.</p>

<p>Most of all Christian visionaries, who dreamt of
the coming of the Fifth Monarchy, the reign of the
saints (in the language of Daniel), crowded round
Manasseh ben Israel. The Thirty Years' War
which had delivered property and life over to wild
soldiers, the tyrannical oppression of believers
struggling for inward freedom and morality&mdash;in
England by the bishops and the secular government,
in France by the despotic Richelieu&mdash;awakened
in visionaries the idea that the Messianic
millennium, announced in the book of Daniel and
the Apocalypse, was near, and that their sufferings
were only the forerunners of the time of grace.
These fantastic visionaries showed themselves
favorable to the Jews; they wished this great
change to be effected with the participation of those
to whom the announcement had first been made.
They conceded that the Jews must first take possession
of the Holy Land, which could not easily be
accomplished, even by a miracle. For, the lost
Ten Tribes must first be found, and gathered together,
if the prophetic words were not to fall to
the ground. The tribes assembled to take possession
of the Holy Land must have their Messiah, a
shoot out of the stem of Jesse. But what would
become of Jesus, the Christ, <i>i. e.</i>, Messiah, in whom
Jews could not be made to believe? Some of the
Fifth Monarchy visionaries conceded to Jews a
Messiah of their own, in the expectation that the
struggle for precedence between the Jewish and the
Christian saviour would decide itself.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_24" id="Page_24">24</a></span>
Such apocalyptic dreams struck a responsive
chord in Manasseh ben Israel's heart. He also expected,
not the reign of the saints, but, according to
Kabbalistic reckoning, the speedy advent of the
Messianic time. The Zohar, the book revered by
him as divine, announced in unambiguous terms,
that Israel's time of grace would begin with the year
5408 of the world (1648). Manasseh in his innermost
being was a mystic, his classical and literary
education being only external varnish, not diminishing
his belief in miracles. Hence he was pleased
with the letter of a Christian visionary of Dantzic,
expressing belief in the restoration of the glory of
the Jews. John Mochinger, of the old Tyrolese
nobility, who had fallen into the whirlpool of mysticism,
wrote to Manasseh ben Israel in the midst of
an eulogium on his learning: "Know and be convinced
that I duly honor your doctrines, and together
with some of my brethren in the faith, earnestly
desire that Israel may be enlightened with
the true light, and enjoy its ancient renown and
happiness." At a later period another German
mystic of Dantzic established relations with the
Kabbalistic Chacham of Amsterdam&mdash;viz., Abraham
von Frankenberg, a nobleman, and a disciple
of Jacob B√∂hme. He openly said: "The true light
will come from the Jews; their time is not far off.
From day to day news will be heard from different
places of wonderful things come to pass in their
favor, and all the islands shall rejoice with them."
In daily intercourse with Manasseh were two Christian
friends, Henry Jesse and Peter Serrarius, who
were enthusiasts in the cause of Israel's restoration.
In France, in the service of the great Cond√©, there
was a peculiar visionary, Isaac La Peyr√®re of Bordeaux,
a Huguenot, perhaps of Jewish-Marrano
blood. He had the strange notion that there were
men before Adam (pre-Adamites), from whom all
men except the Jews were descended. In a book<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_25" id="Page_25">25</a></span>
on the subject, which brought him to the dungeon
of the Inquisition, he attached great importance to
the Jews. In another work on "The Return of the
Jews," he maintained that the Jews ought to be recalled
from their dispersion in all parts of the world,
to effect a speedy return to the Holy Land. The
king of France, the eldest son of the Church, has
the duty to bring about this return of the eldest son
of God. He, too, entered into communication with
Manasseh.</p>

<p>The greatest number of ardent admirers "God's
people" found in England, precisely among those
who had powerful influence in the council and the
camp. At the time when the Germans were fighting
each other on account of difference of creed,
invoking the interference of foreigners, and impairing
their own freedom and power, England was
gaining what could never be taken away, religious
and, at the same time, political freedom, and this
made it a most powerful and prosperous country.
In Germany the religious parties, Catholics, Lutherans,
and Calvinists, in selfish blindness demanded
religious freedom each for itself alone, reserving
oppression and persecution for the others. These
internecine quarrels of the Germans were utilized
by the princes to confirm their own despotic power.
In England, the same selfishness prevailed among
the Episcopalians, Presbyterians, and Catholics, but
a fourth party arose whose motto was religious
freedom for all. The senseless despotism of
Charles I and the narrow-mindedness of the Long
Parliament had played into the hands of this intelligent
and powerful party. England, like Germany,
resembled a great blood-stained battle-field, but it
had produced men who knew what they wanted,
who staked their lives for it, and effected the rejuvenescence
of the nation. Oliver Cromwell was at once
the head which devised, and the arm which executed
sound ideas. By the sword he and his army obtained<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_26" id="Page_26">26</a></span>
religious freedom, not only for themselves,
but also for others. He and his officers were not
revengeful freebooters or blood-thirsty soldiers, but
high-minded, inspired warriors of God, who waged
war against wickedness and falseness, and hoped
for, and undertook to establish a moral system of
government, the kingdom of God. Like the Maccabees
of old, the Puritan warriors fought "sword in
hand, and praise of God in their mouth." Cromwell
and his soldiers read the Bible as often as they
fought. But not out of the New Testament could
the Roundheads derive inspiration and warlike courage.
The Christian Bible, with its monkish figures,
its exorcists, its praying brethren, and pietistic saints,
supplied no models for warriors contending with a
faithless king, a false aristocracy, and unholy priests.
Only the great heroes of the Old Testament, with
fear of God in their hearts and the sword in their
hands, at once religious and national champions,
could serve as models for the Puritans: the Judges,
freeing the oppressed people from the yoke of foreign
domination; Saul, David, and Joab, routing the
foes of their country; and Jehu, making an end of
an idolatrous and blasphemous royal house&mdash;these
were favorite characters with Puritan warriors. In
every verse of the books of Joshua, Judges, Samuel,
and Kings, they saw their own condition reflected;
every psalm seemed composed for them, to teach
them that, though surrounded on every side by ungodly
foes, they need not fear while they trusted in
God. Oliver Cromwell compared himself to the
judge Gideon, who first obeyed the voice of God
hesitatingly, but afterwards courageously scattered
the attacking heathens; or to Judas Maccab√¶us,
who out of a handful of martyrs formed a host of
victorious warriors.</p>

<p>To bury oneself in the history, prophecy, and
poetry of the Old Testament, to revere them
as divine inspiration, to live in them with every<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_27" id="Page_27">27</a></span>
emotion, yet not to consider the people who had
originated all this glory and greatness as preferred
and chosen, was impossible. Among the
Puritans, therefore, were many earnest admirers of
"God's people," and Cromwell was one of them.
It seemed a marvel that the people, or a remnant of
the people, whom God had distinguished by great
favor and stern discipline, should still exist. A
desire was excited in the hearts of the Puritans to
see this living wonder, the Jewish people, with their
own eyes, to bring Jews to England, and, by making
them part of the theocratic community about to be
established, stamp it with the seal of completion.
The sentiments of the Puritans towards the Jews
were expressed in Oliver Cromwell's observation,
"Great is my sympathy with this poor people, whom
God chose, and to whom He gave His law; it rejects
Jesus, because it does not recognize him as the
Messiah." Cromwell dreamt of a reconciliation of
the Old and the New Testament, of an intimate
connection between the Jewish people of God and
the English Puritan theocracy. But other Puritans
were so absorbed in the Old Testament that the
New Testament was of no importance. Especially
the visionaries in Cromwell's army and among the
members of Parliament, who were hoping for the
Fifth Monarchy, or the reign of the saints, assigned to
the Jewish people a glorious position in the expected
millennium. A Puritan preacher, Nathaniel Holmes
(Holmesius), wished, according to the letter of many
prophetic verses, to become the servant of Israel,
and serve him on bended knees. The more the
tension in England increased through the imprisonment
of the king, the dissensions between the Presbyterian
Long Parliament and the Puritan army, the
civil war, the execution of King Charles, and the
establishment of a republic in England, the more
public life and religious thought assumed Jewish
coloring. The only thing wanting to make one think<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_28" id="Page_28">28</a></span>
himself in Jud√¶a was for the orators in Parliament
to speak Hebrew. One author proposed the
seventh day as the day of rest, and in a work showed
the holiness of this day, and the duty of the English
people to honor it. This was in the beginning of
1649. Parliament, it is true, condemned this work
to be burnt as heretical, scandalous, and profane,
and sentenced the printer and author to punishment.
But the Israelite spirit among the Puritans, especially
among the Levelers, or ultra-republicans, was not
suppressed by these means. Many wished the
government to declare the Torah to be the code for
England.</p>

<p>These proceedings in the British islands, which
promised the exaltation of Israel at no distant period,
were followed by Manasseh with beating heart.
Did these voices not announce the coming of the
Messianic kingdom? He hoped so, and put forth
feverish activity to help to bring about the desired
time. He entertained a visionary train of thought.
The Messiah could not appear till the punishment of
Israel, to be scattered from one end of the earth to
the other, had been fulfilled. There were no Jews
then living in England. Exertions must be made
to obtain permission for Jews to dwell in England,
that this hindrance to the advent of the Messiah
might be removed. Manasseh therefore put himself
into communication with some important persons,
who assured him that "the minds of men were
favorable to the Jews, and that they would be acceptable
and welcome to Englishmen." What especially
justified his hopes was the "Apology" by
Edward Nicholas, former secretary to Parliament,
"for the honorable nation of the Jews." In this
work, which the author dedicated to the Long
Parliament, the Jews were treated, as the chosen
people of God, with a tenderness to which they were
not accustomed. Hence the author felt it necessary
to affirm at the end, that he wrote it, not at the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_29" id="Page_29">29</a></span>
instigation of Jews, but out of love to God and his
country. The opinion of the apologist was, that the
great sufferings brought upon England by the religious
and civil war were a just punishment for
English persecution of the saints and favorites of
God, <i>i. e.</i>, the Jews, and an urgent admonition to
atone for this great sin by admitting them and showing
them brotherly treatment. The author proved
the preference and selection of Israel by many
biblical quotations. He referred to a preacher who
had said in Parliament in connection with the verse:
"Touch not mine anointed, and do my prophets no
harm," that the weal or woe of the world depended
upon the good or bad treatment of God's people.
God in His secret counsel had sustained this people
to the present day, and a glorious future was reserved
for them. Hence it was the duty of Englishmen to
endeavor to comfort them, if possible give them
satisfaction for their innocent blood shed in this
kingdom, and enter into friendly intercourse with
them. This work also defends the Jews against the
accusation of having crucified Jesus. The death of
Jesus took place at the instigation of the Synhedrion,
not of the people. In most impressive terms it
urges the English to comfort the afflicted and unhappy
Jews. The pope and his adherents, he said,
would be enraged at the kind treatment of the
Jews, for they still inflicted cruelty and humiliation
upon the people of God, the popes compelling the
Jews to wear opprobrious badges, and Catholics
avoiding all contact with them, because they abhorred
idols and heathen worship.</p>

<p>This work, which, more than friendly, absolutely
glorified the Jews, excited the greatest attention in
England and Holland. Manasseh ben Israel was
delighted with it, thinking that he was near his object,
especially as his friend Holmes at once communicated
with him on the subject, saying that he
himself was about to prepare a work on the millennium,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_30" id="Page_30">30</a></span>
in which he would emphasize the importance
of the Jews in the molding of the future. Manasseh
ben Israel immediately set to work to do his share
towards the realization of his object. He, however,
as well as the Christian mystics in England, had
one anxiety; what had become of the lost Ten
Tribes banished by the Assyrian king Shalmanassar?
A restoration of the Jewish kingdom without these
Ten Tribes seemed impossible, nay, their discovery
was the guarantee of the truth of the prophetic promises.
The union of Judah and Israel which some of the
prophets had impressively announced would remain
unfulfilled if the Ten Tribes had ceased to exist.
Manasseh, therefore, laid great stress upon being
able to prove their existence somewhere. Fortunately
he was in a position to specify the situation
of the Ten Tribes. Some years before, a Jewish
traveler, named Montezinos, had affirmed on oath
that he had seen native Jews of the tribe of Reuben,
in South America, and had held communication
with them. The circumstantiality of his tale excited
curiosity, and inclined his contemporaries to belief.
Antonio de Montezinos was a Marrano, whom business
or love of travel had led to America. There
he had stumbled upon a Mestizo (Indian), who had
excited in him a suspicion that members of his race
were living in America, persecuted and oppressed
by the Indians, as the Indians had been by the
Spaniards, and later experiences confirmed the
suspicion.</p>

<p>Antonio de Montezinos, or Aaron Levi, had
brought the surprising news to Amsterdam, and
had related it under oath to a number of persons,
among them Manasseh ben Israel (about 1644).
Afterwards he went to Brazil, and there died. On
his deathbed he repeatedly asserted the truth of
the existence of some Israelite tribes in America.
Manasseh ben Israel was firmly convinced by the
statement of this man, and made it the foundation<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_31" id="Page_31">31</a></span>
of a work, entitled "Israel's Hope," composed to
pave the way for the Messianic time. The Ten
Tribes, according to his assumption, had been dispersed
to Tartary and China, and some might have
gone thence to the American continent. Some indications
and certain manners and customs of the
Indians, resembling those of the Jews, seemed to
him to favor this idea. The prophetic announcement
of the perpetuity of the Israelite people had
accordingly been confirmed; moreover there were
signs that the tribes were ready to come forth from
their hiding-places and unite with the others. The
time of redemption, which, it was true, could not be
foretold, and in the calculation of which many had
erred, appeared at last to be approaching. The
prophets' threats of punishment to the Jews had
been fulfilled in a terrible manner; why should not
their hope-awakening promises be verified? What
unspeakable cruelty the monster of the Inquisition
had inflicted, and still continued to inflict, on the
poor innocents of the Jewish race, on adults and
children of every age and either sex! For what
reason? Because they would not depart from the
Law of Moses, revealed to them amidst so many
miracles. For it numberless victims had perished
wherever the tyrannical rule of the Inquisition was
exercised. And martyrs continued to show incredible
firmness, permitting themselves to be burnt
alive to honor the name of God.</p>

<p>Manasseh enumerated all the autos-da-f√© of Marranos
and other Jewish martyrs which had taken
place in his time.</p>

<p>Great excitement was caused among Dutch Portuguese
Jews by the burning of a young Marrano,
twenty-five years old, well read in Latin and Greek
literature. Isaac de Castro-Tartas, born at Tartas,
a small town in Gascony, had come with his parents
to Amsterdam. Glowing with zeal and a desire to
bring back to Judaism those Marranos who continued<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_32" id="Page_32">32</a></span>
Christians, he prepared to travel to Brazil.
In vain his parents and friends warned him against
this mad step. In Bahia he was arrested by the
Portuguese, recognized as a Jew, sent to Lisbon,
and handed over to the Inquisition. This body had
no formal right over Isaac de Castro, for when
arrested he was a Dutch citizen. The tribunal in
vain tried to induce him to abjure Judaism. Young
De Castro-Tartas was determined manfully to endure
a martyr's death in honor of his faith. His
death was attended with the <i>√©clat</i> he had longed
for. In Lisbon the funeral pile was kindled for him
and several others, on December 22d, 1647. He
cried out of the flames, "Hear, O Israel, God is
one," in so impressive a tone that the witnesses of
the dreadful spectacle were greatly moved. For
several days nothing else was talked of in the
capital but the dreadful voice of the martyr Isaac de
Castro-Tartas and the "Shema," uttered with his
last breath. People spoke of it shudderingly. The
Inquisition was obliged to forbid the uttering of the
word "Shema" with a threat of heavy punishment.
It is said, too, that at that time it was determined to
burn no more Jewish heretics alive in Lisbon.</p>

<p>The Amsterdam community was stunned by the
news of successive executions of youthful sufferers.
De Castro-Tartas had parents, relatives, and friends
in Amsterdam, and was beloved on account of his
knowledge and character. The rabbi, Saul Morteira,
delivered a memorial address on his death.
Poets deplored and honored him in Hebrew and
Spanish verses, and, horrified by the new atrocities
of the Inquisition against Jews, Manasseh ben Israel
wrote "Israel's Hope." Even the reader of to-day
can feel grief trembling in every word. Indeed, if
martyrs could prove the truth and tenability of the
cause for which they bleed, Judaism needs no further
proof; for no people and no religion on earth have
produced such numerous and firm martyrs. Manasseh<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_33" id="Page_33">33</a></span>
used this proof to draw the conclusion that,
as promised sufferings had been inflicted, so the
promised redemption and regeneration of God's
people would be fulfilled. He sent this Latin
treatise on the existence of the Ten Tribes and their
hopes to a prominent and learned personage in
England, to be read before Parliament, which was
under Cromwell's influence, and before the Council
of State. In an accompanying letter Manasseh explained
to Parliament his favorite idea, that the
return of the Jews to their native land&mdash;the time
for which was so near&mdash;must be preceded by their
complete dispersion. The dispersion, according to
the words of Scripture, was to be from one end of
the earth to the other, naturally including the island
of England, in the extreme north of the inhabited
world. But for more than 300 years no Jews had
lived in England; therefore, he added the request
that the Council and Parliament grant Jews permission
to settle in England, to have the free exercise
of their religion, and to build synagogues there
(1650). Manasseh made no secret of his Messianic
hopes, because he could and did reckon upon the
fact that the saints or Puritans themselves wished
for the "assembling of God's people" in their ancestral
home, and were inclined to help and promote
it. He also intimated in his letter, that he was resolved
to go to England, to arrange for the settlement
of the Jews.</p>

<p>Manasseh ben Israel had not reckoned amiss.
His request and dedication were favorably received
by Parliament. Lord Middlesex, probably the mediator,
sent him a letter of thanks with the superscription,
"To my dear brother, the Hebrew philosopher,
Manasseh ben Israel." A passport to England
was also sent to him. The English ambassador
in Holland, Lord Oliver St. John, a relative of
Cromwell, told him that he wished to go to the
Amsterdam synagogue, and gave him to understand,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_34" id="Page_34">34</a></span>
probably according to Cromwell's instructions, that
England was inclined to gratify the long-cherished
wish of the Jews. Manasseh took care that he be
received in the house of prayer with music and
hymns (about August, 1651). However, the goal
to which he seemed so near was removed by political
complications. England and Holland entered
into a fierce war, which broke off the connection between
Amsterdam and London. Manasseh's relations
to his elder colleague, Saul Morteira (1652),
and the president, Joseph da Costa&mdash;it is not known
on what account&mdash;became strained, and in an angry
mood he formed the resolution to leave Amsterdam.
The directors of the community succeeded
in establishing a tolerable understanding between
the two chachams, but Manasseh had neither the
cheerfulness required nor a favorable opportunity
to resume his adventurous scheme.</p>

<p>But when Oliver Cromwell, by the illegal but
necessary dissolution of the Long Parliament, assumed
the chief power in April, 1653, and showed
an inclination to conclude peace with the States
General, Manasseh again took up his project.
Cromwell had called together a new parliament, the
so-called Short, or Barebones, Parliament, which
was composed wholly of saints, <i>i. e.</i>, Puritan preachers,
officers with a biblical bias, and millennium visionaries.
The partiality of Cromwell's officers for the
old Jewish system is shown by the serious proposition
that the Council of State should consist of
seventy members, after the number of the Jewish
synhedrion. In Parliament sat General Harrison, a
Baptist, who, with his party, wished to see the
Mosaic law introduced into England. When Parliament
met (July 5, 1653), Manasseh hastened to repeat
his request, that Jews be granted permission
to reside in England. The question of the Jews
was immediately put on the programme of business.
Parliament sent Manasseh a safe conduct to London,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_35" id="Page_35">35</a></span>
that he might conduct the business in person.
As the war between England and Holland still continued,
his relatives and friends urged him not to
expose himself to the danger of a daily change of
affairs, and he again put off his voyage to a more
favorable time. The Short Parliament was soon
dissolved (December 12, 1653), and Cromwell obtained
kingly power under the title of Protector of
the Realm. When he concluded peace with Holland
(April, 1654), Manasseh thought the time well
suited for effecting his wishes for the redemption of
Israel. He was encouraged by the fact that three
admirals of the English fleet had drawn up a petition
in October, 1654, to admit Jews into England.
Manasseh presented his petition for their admission
to Cromwell's second, still shorter Parliament, and,
probably at his instigation, David Abrabanel Dormido,
one of the leading men at Amsterdam, at the
same time presented one to the same effect, which
Cromwell urgently recommended to the Council
for speedy decision (November 3, 1654).</p>

<p>Manasseh reveled in intoxicating dreams of the
approaching glorious time for Israel. He regarded
himself as the instrument of Providence to bring
about its fulfillment. In these dreams he was upheld
and confirmed by Christian mystics, who were
eagerly awaiting the millennium. The Dutchman,
Henry Jesse, had shortly before published a work,
"On the Speedy Glory of Judah and Israel," in the
Dutch language. The Bohemian physician, mystic,
and alchemist, Paul Felgenhauer, went beyond the
bounds of reason. Disgusted with the formal creed
of the Evangelical Church, and the idolatrous tendency
of Catholicism, he wrote during the Thirty
Years' War against the corruption of the Church
and the Protestant clergy, and wished for a spiritual,
mystical religion. By a peculiar calculation, Felgenhauer
was led to believe that the year six thousand
and the advent of the Messiah connected with it<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_36" id="Page_36">36</a></span>
were not far off. Persecuted in Germany by Catholics
and Protestants, he sought an asylum in Amsterdam,
and there formed the acquaintance of
Manasseh ben Israel. Between these men and a
third visionary, Peter Serrarius, the speedy coming
of the Messianic time was often the subject of conversation.
Felgenhauer then composed an original
work (December, 1654) entitled "Good News of
the Messiah for Israel! The redemption of Israel
from all his sufferings, his deliverance from captivity,
and the glorious advent of the Messiah are nigh
for the comfort of Israel. Taken from the Holy
Scriptures of the Old and New Testament, by a
Christian who is expecting him with the Jews."
Felgenhauer places the Jewish people very high, as
the seed of Abraham, and considers true believers
of all nations the spiritual seed of Abraham. Hence
Jews and Christians should love, not despise, one
another. They should unite in God. This union
is near at hand. The bloody wars of nation against
nation by sea and land in the whole world, which
had not happened before to anything like the same
extent, are signs thereof. As further signs he accounted
the comets which appeared in 1618, 1648,
and 1652, and the furious Polish war kindled by the
Cossacks. Verses from the Bible, especially from
Daniel and the Apocalypse, with daring interpretations,
served him as proofs. Felgenhauer denied
an earthly Messiah, nor did he allow the claim of
Jesus to the title.</p>

<p>As this half-insane work was dedicated to Manasseh,
he was obliged to answer it, which he did with
great prudence (February 1, 1655), gladly welcoming
the pages favorable to Jews, and passing over
the rest in silence. The good news concerning the
near future was the more welcome to his heart, he
said, as he himself, in spite of the afflictions of many
centuries, did not cease ardently to hope for better
times.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_37" id="Page_37">37</a></span></p>

<blockquote>

<p>"How gladly would I believe you, that the time is near when God,
who has so long been angry with us, will again comfort His people,
and deliver it from more than Babylonian captivity, and more than
Egyptian bondage! Your sign of the commencement of the Messianic
age, the announcement of the exaltation of Israel throughout
the whole world, appears to me not only probable, but plain and
clear. A not inconsiderable number of these announcements (on the
Christian side) for the consolation of Zion have been sent to me from
Frankenberg and Mochinger, from France and Hungary. And from
England alone how many voices! They are like that small cloud in
the time of the prophet Elijah, which suddenly extended so that it
covered the whole of the heavens."</p></blockquote>

<p>Manasseh ben Israel had the courage to express
without ambiguity Jewish expectations in opposition
to the opinions held by Christian enthusiasts. They,
for the most part, imagined the fifth monarchy,
which they alleged was about to commence, as the
millennium, when Jesus would again appear and hand
over the sovereign power to the saints. The Jews
would have a share in it; they would assemble from
the ends of the earth, return to their ancestral home,
and again build Jerusalem and the Temple. But
this would be only an intermediate state, the means
to enable the whole Twelve Tribes to acknowledge
Jesus as Messiah, so that there be but one flock
under one shepherd. Against this Manasseh ben
Israel composed a treatise, ended April 25, 1655,
on the fifth kingdom of the prophecy of Daniel,
interpreting it to mean the independence of
Israel. In this work, called "The Glorious Stone,
or the Image of Nebuchadnezzar," and dedicated to
Isaac Vossius, then in the service of the queen of
Sweden, he put forth all his learning to show that
the visions of the "four beasts," or great kingdoms,
had been verified in the successive sway of the
Babylonians, Persians, Greeks, and Romans, and
therefore the coming of the fifth kingdom also was
certain. This was shown in Daniel plainly enough
to be the kingdom of Israel, the people of God. In
this Messianic kingdom all nations of the earth will
have part, and they will be treated with kindness,
but the authority will ever rest with Israel. Manasseh<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_38" id="Page_38">38</a></span>
disfigured this simple thought by Kabbalistic
triviality and sophistry. It is singular that not only
did a learned Christian accept the dedication of this
essentially Jewish work, but the celebrated painter
Rembrandt supplied four artistic engravings representing
Nebuchadnezzar's, or Manasseh's vision.</p>

<p>Manasseh had received a friendly invitation from
the second Parliament assembled by Cromwell; but
as it had meanwhile been dissolved, he could not
begin his journey until invited by the Protector
himself. He seems to have sent on in advance his
son, Samuel ben Israel, who was presented by the
University of Oxford, in consideration of his knowledge
and natural gifts, with the degree of doctor of
philosophy and medicine, and according to custom,
received the gold ring, the biretta, and the kiss of
peace. It was no insignificant circumstance that
this honor should be conferred upon a Jew by a
university strictly Christian in its conduct. Cromwell's
will appears to have been decisive in the
matter. He sent an invitation to Manasseh, but the
journey was delayed till autumn. Not till the end
of the Tishri festivals (October 25&ndash;31, 1655) did
Manasseh undertake the important voyage to London,
in his view, of the utmost consequence to the
world. He was received in a friendly manner by
Cromwell, and had a residence granted him.
Among his companions was Jacob Sasportas, a
learned man, accustomed to intercourse with persons
of high rank, who had been rabbi in African
cities. Other Jews accompanied him in the hope
that the admission of Jews would meet with no difficulty.
Some secret Jews from Spain and Portugal
were already domiciled in London, among them
being the rich and respected Fernandez Carvajal.
But the matter did not admit of such speedy settlement.
At an audience, Manasseh delivered to the
Protector a carefully composed petition, or address.
He had obtained the authorization of the Jews of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_39" id="Page_39">39</a></span>
the different countries of Europe to act as their
representative, so that the admission of Jews into
England might be urged not in his own name alone,
but in that of the whole Jewish nation. In his petition
he skillfully developed the argument, by means
of passages from the Bible and the Talmud, that
power and authority are conferred by God according
to his will; that God rewards and punishes even the
rulers of the earth, and that this had been verified in
Jewish history; that great monarchs who had troubled
Israel had met with an unhappy end, as
Pharaoh, Nebuchadnezzar, Antiochus Epiphanes,
Pompey, and others. On the other hand, benefactors
of the Jewish nation had enjoyed happiness
even here below, so that the word of God to
Abraham had been literally <span class="locked">fulfilled:&mdash;</span></p>

<blockquote>

<p>"'I will bless them that bless thee, and curse them that curse thee.'
Hence I, one of the least among the Hebrews, since by experience I
have found, that through God's great bounty towards us, many considerable
and eminent persons both of piety and power are moved
with sincere and inward pity and compassion towards us, and do
comfort us concerning the approaching Deliverance of Israel, could
not but for myself, and in the behalf of my countrymen, make this my
humble Address to your Highness, and beseech you for God's sake
that ye would, according to that piety and power wherein you are
eminent beyond others, vouchsafe to grant that the great and glorious
name of the Lord our God may be extolled, and solemnly worshiped
and praised by us through all the bounds of this Commonwealth; and
to grant us place in your country, that we may have our Synagogues,
and free exercise of our religion. Pagans have of old ... granted
free liberty even to apostate Jews: ... how much more then may
we, that are not Apostate or runagate Jews, hope it from your Highness
and your Christian Council, since you have so great knowledge
of, and adore the same one only God of Israel, together with us....
For our people did ... presage that ... the ancient hatred
towards them would also be changed into goodwill: that those
rigorous laws, ... against so innocent a people would happily be
repealed."</p></blockquote>

<p class="in0">At the same time Manasseh ben Israel circulated
through the press a "Declaration" which served to
explain the reasons for admitting Jews, and to meet
objections and allay prejudices against their admission.
All his reasons can be reduced to two&mdash;one
mystical and one of trade policy. The mystical<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_40" id="Page_40">40</a></span>
reason has been repeatedly explained. His opinion
coincided with that of many Christians, that the
return of the Israelites to their home was near at
hand. According to his view the general dispersion
of the Jews must precede this <span class="locked">event:&mdash;</span></p>

<blockquote>

<p>"Now we know how our nation is spread all about, and has its seat
and dwelling in the most flourishing countries of the world, as well
in America as in the other three parts thereof, except only in this
considerable and mighty island. And therefore, before the Messiah
come ... first we must have our seat here likewise."</p></blockquote>

<p class="in0">The other reason was put in this form: that through
the Jews the trade of England would greatly
increase in exports and imports from all parts of
the world. He developed this point of the advantage
which the Jews might bestow at great length,
showing that on account of their fidelity and attachment
to the countries hospitable and friendly to
them they deserved to be treated with consideration.
Besides, they ought to be esteemed, on account of
their ancient nobility and purity of blood, among a
people which attached importance to such distinctions.</p>

<p>Manasseh ben Israel considered the commerce
to which Jews were for the most part devoted from
a higher point of view. He had in mind the wholesale
trade of the Portuguese Jews of Holland in
the coin of various nations (exchange business), in
diamonds, cochineal, indigo, wine, and oil. Their
money transactions were not based on usury, on
which the Jews of Germany and Poland relied.
The Amsterdam Jews deposited their capital in
banks, and satisfied themselves with five per cent
interest. The capital of the Portuguese Jews in
Holland and Italy was very considerable, because
Marranos in Spain and Portugal invested their
money with them, to evade the avarice of the Inquisition.
Hence Manasseh laid great weight on the
advantages which England might expect from his
enterprising countrymen. He thought that trading,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_41" id="Page_41">41</a></span>
the chief occupation, and, to a certain extent, the
natural inclination, of the Jews of all countries since
their dispersion, was the work of Providence, a mark
of divine favor towards them, that by accumulated
treasures they might find grace in the eyes of rulers
and nations. They were forced to occupy themselves
with commerce, because, owing to the insecurity
of their existence, they could not possess landed
estates. Accordingly, they were obliged to pursue
trade till their return to their land, for then "there
shall be no more any trader in the house of the
Lord," as a prophet declares.</p>

<p>Manasseh ben Israel then took a survey over all
the countries where Jews, in his time, or shortly
before, by means of trade, had attained to importance,
and enumerated the persons who had risen to
high positions by their services to states or rulers.
However, much that he adduced, when closely considered,
is not very brilliant, with the exception of
the esteemed and secure position which the Jews
occupied in Holland. Then he quoted examples of
the fidelity and devotedness of Jews in ancient and
modern times towards their protectors. He forcibly
refuted the calumny that the Jews had been banished
from Spain and Portugal for treachery and faithlessness.
It was easy for him to show from Christian
authors that the expulsion of the Jews, and their
cruel treatment by Portugal, were at once criminal
and foolish, and most emphatically condemned by
wise rulers. He took occasion to defend his brethren
against three other charges: usury, child murder,
and proselytism. To wipe off the stain of
usury, he made use of the justification employed by
Simone Luzzatto, a contemporary Jewish Italian
author, that usury was objectionable not in itself, but
in its excess. Of great weight was the fact which
he adduced, that the Portuguese Jews, for whom he
was pleading, abhorred usury as much as many
Christians, and that their large capital had not been<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_42" id="Page_42">42</a></span>
obtained from it. Manasseh could repudiate with
more vehemence the charge of murdering Christian
children. Christians made the accusation, he thought,
pretty much from the motives that influenced the
negroes of Guinea and Brazil, who tormented those
just escaped from shipwreck, or visited by misfortune
in general, by assuming that such persons
were accursed of God.</p>

<blockquote>

<p>"We live not amongst the Black-moors and wild-men, but amongst
the white and civilized people of the world, yet we find this an ordinary
course, that men are very prone to hate and despise him that
hath ill fortune; and on the other side, to make much of those whom
fortune doth favor."</p></blockquote>

<p>Manasseh reminded the Christians that there had
been a time when they, too, had been charged by
heathens with being murderers of children, sorcerers,
and conjurers, and had been punished by heathen
emperors and officials. He was able to refer to a
case of his own time, that of Isaac Jeshurun, of
Ragusa, a Jew repeatedly tortured for child murder,
whose innocence had come to light, and filled the
judges with remorse. Manasseh denied the accusation
of the conversion of Christians to Judaism,
and referred to the injunction of the Jewish law to
dissuade rather than attract proselytes.</p>

<blockquote>

<p>"Now, because I believe, that with a good conscience I have discharged
our nation of the Jews of those three slanders.... I may
from these two qualities, of Profitableness and Fidelity, conclude,
that such a nation ought to be well entertained, and also beloved and
protected generally of all. The more, considering they are called in
the Sacred Scriptures the sons of God.... I could add a
third (point), viz., of the Nobility of the Jews, but because that point
is enough known amongst all Christians, as lately it has been shown
... by that worthy Christian minister, Mr. Henry Jessey ...
and by Mr. Edw. Nicholas, Gentleman. Therefore I will here forbear
and rest on the saying of Solomon ... 'Let another man's mouth
praise thee, and not thine own.'"</p></blockquote>

<p>Cromwell was decidedly inclined to the admission
of the Jews. He may have had in view the probability
that the extensive trade and capital of the
Spanish and Portuguese Jews, those professing Judaism<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_43" id="Page_43">43</a></span>
openly as well as secretly, might be brought to
England, which at that time could not yet compete
with Holland. He was also animated by the great
idea of the unconditional toleration of all religions,
and even thought of granting religious freedom to
the intensely hated, feared, hence persecuted Catholics.
Therefore, he acceded to the wish of the
Jews to open an asylum to them in England. But
he was most influenced by the religious desire to
win over the Jews to Christianity by friendly treatment.
He thought that Christianity, as preached
in England by the Independents, without idolatry
and superstition, would captivate the Jews, hitherto
deterred from Christianity.</p>

<p>Cromwell and Manasseh ben Israel agreed in an
unexpressed, visionary, Messianic reason for the
admission of Jews into England. The Kabbalistic
rabbi thought that in consequence of the settlement
of Jews in the British island, the Messianic redemption
would commence, and the Puritan Protector
believed that Jews in great numbers would accept
Christianity, and then would come the time of one
shepherd and one flock. To dispose the people
favorably towards the Jews, Cromwell employed two
most zealous Independents, his secretary, the clergyman
Hugh Peters, and Harry Marten, the fiery
member of the Council, to labor at the task.</p>

<p>At last the time came to consider the question of
the admission of Jews seriously. They had been
banished in the year 1290 in pursuance of a decree
enacting that they should never return, and it was
questionable whether the decree was not still in
force. Therefore, Cromwell assembled a commission
at Whitehall (December 4, 1655), to discuss
every aspect of the matter. The commission was
composed of Lord Chief Justice Glynn, Lord Chief
Baron Steel, and seven citizens, including the Lord
Mayor, the two sheriffs of London, an alderman, and
the recorder of the city, and fourteen eminent clergymen<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_44" id="Page_44">44</a></span>
of different towns. Cromwell mentioned two
subjects for discussion: whether it was lawful to
admit Jews into England, and, in case it was not
opposed to the law, under what conditions the
admission should take place. Manasseh had formulated
his proposal under seven heads: that they
should be admitted and protected against violence;
that they should be granted synagogues, the free
exercise of religion, and places of burial; that they
should enjoy freedom of trade; and that their disputes
should be settled by their own rabbis and
directors; and that all former laws hostile to
Jews should be repealed for their greater security.
On admission, every Jew should take the oath of
fidelity to the realm.</p>

<p>There was great excitement in London during the
discussion on the admission of the Jews, and popular
feeling was much divided. Blind hatred against
the crucifiers of the Son of God, and blind love for
the people of God; fear of the competition of Jews
in trade, and hope of gaining the precedence from
the Dutch and Spaniards by their means, prejudiced
ideas that they crucified Christian children, clipped
coin, or wished to make all the English people Jews&mdash;these
conflicting feelings disturbed the judgment
for and against them. Cromwell's followers, and
the Republicans in general, were for their admission;
Royalists and Papists, secretly or openly his
enemies, were opposed to the proposal. The people
crowded to the hall where the Jewish question was
publicly discussed. At the very beginning the legal
representatives declared that no ancient law excluded
the Jews from England, for their banishment
had been enacted by the king, without the consent
of Parliament. The city representatives remained
silent; the most violent were the clergy, who could
not rid themselves of their hatred against Jews,
derived from the gospels and their theological literature.
Cromwell, who most earnestly wished to see<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_45" id="Page_45">45</a></span>
them admitted, therefore added three clergymen,
among them Hugh Peters, from whom he expected
a vote favorable to the Jews. The question was not
brought to a decision in three sittings. Cromwell
therefore ordered a final discussion (December 18,
1655), at which he presided. The majority of the
clergy on this day, too, were against the admission
of Jews, even the minority favoring it only with due
precautions. Cromwell, dissatisfied with the course
of the discussion, first had the theological objections
refuted by Manasseh ben Israel, then expressed himself
with much warmth, and reprimanded the clergy.
He said that he had hoped to receive enlightenment
for his conscience; instead, they had made
the question more obscure. The main strength of
his arguments was: The pure (Puritan) gospel must
be preached to the Jews, to win them to the church.
"But can we preach to them, if we will not tolerate
them among us?" Cromwell thereupon closed the
discussion, and resolved to decide the matter according
to his own judgment.</p>

<p>He had not only the opposition of the fanatical
clergy to contend against, but also that of the multitude,
who shared their prejudiced feeling. The
enemies of the Jews made every effort to win over
the people against their admission. They spread
the report that the Jews intended to buy the library
of the University of Oxford, and, if possible, turn St.
Paul's into a synagogue. They sought to bring
Cromwell's friendship for the Jews under suspicion,
and circulated the report that an embassy had come
to England from Asia and Prague to find out
whether Cromwell was not the expected Messiah of
the Jews. A clerical pamphleteer, named William
Prynne, stirred up a most fanatical excitement
against the Jews. He composed a venomous work,
"A Short Demurrer," in which he raked up all false
accusations against them of counterfeit coining, and
the crucifixion of Christian children, and briefly<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_46" id="Page_46">46</a></span>
summarized the anti-Jewish decrees of the thirteenth
century, so as to make the name of Jew hated.
From other quarters, also, various publications
appeared against them. John Hoornbeek, a Dutchman,
composed a book on the conversion of the
Jews, in which he pretended to be their friend, but
actually sought to asperse them. John Dury, an
Englishman residing at the time at Cassel, was also
resolved to make his voice heard about the Jews;
he weighed arguments for and against their admission,
and at last inclined to the view that it was a
serious matter to permit Jews to enter England.
His work was printed and distributed. Probably at
Cromwell's suggestion, Thomas Collier wrote a
refutation of Prynne's charges, dedicating it to the
Protector. He even justified the crucifixion of Jesus
by the Jews, and concluded his work with a passage
in the taste of that time:</p>

<blockquote>

<p>"Oh, let us respect them; let us wait for that glorious day which
will make them the head of the nations. Oh, the time is at hand
when every one shall think himself happy that can but lay hold on
the skirt of a Jew. Our salvation came from them! Our Jesus was
of them! We are gotten into their promises and privileges! The
natural branches were cut off, that we might be grafted on! Oh, let
us not be high-minded, but fear. Let us not, for God's sake, be unmerciful
to them! No! let it be enough if we have all their [spiritual]
riches."</p></blockquote>

<p>While the admission of Jews met with so many
difficulties in England, the Dutch Government was
by no means pleased with Manasseh ben Israel's
efforts to bring it to pass, fearing, doubtless, that the
Amsterdam Jews would remove to England, with all
their capital. Manasseh was obliged to pacify the
Dutch ambassador in an interview, and to assure
him that his exertions concerned not Dutch Jews,
but the Marranos, watched with Argus eyes in
Spain and Portugal, for whom he wished to provide
an asylum. Manasseh waited six months in London
to obtain from Cromwell a favorable decision,
but without success. The Protector found no leisure<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_47" id="Page_47">47</a></span>
to attend to the Jewish question, his energies
were devoted to obtaining the funds necessary for
the government and foreign wars, refused by one
Parliament after another, and to frustrating the
royalist conspiracy against his life. Manasseh's
companions, who had given up all hopes of success,
left London; others who, having fled from the
Pyrenean peninsula, were on their way thither,
turned back, and settled in Italy or Geneva.</p>

<p>But the friends of the Jews were unwearied, and
hoped to produce a change of mind in the people.
One of "the saints" published a small work (April,
1656), in which he briefly summarized the proceedings
at the discussion on the admission of Jews, and
then added:</p>

<blockquote>

<p>"What shall be the issue of this, the most high God knoweth;
Rabbi Manasseh ben Israel still remains in London, desiring a favorable
answer to his proposals; and not receiving it he hath desired, that
if they may not be granted, he may have a favorable dismission, and
return home. But other great affairs being now in hand, and this
being business of very great concernment, no absolute answer is yet
returned to him."</p></blockquote>

<p>To elicit a thorough refutation of all the charges
advanced by the enemies of the Jews and the opponents
of toleration, a person of high rank, in close
relation with the government, induced Manasseh
ben Israel to publish a brief but comprehensive
work, in defense of the Jews. In the form of a letter
he stated all the grounds of accusation. These
included the current slanders: the use of the blood
of Christians at the Passover, curses upon Christians
and blasphemy against the God of the Christians
in Jewish prayers, and the idolatrous reverence
alleged to be shown the Torah-scrolls. The defense
of the Jews, which Manasseh ben Israel composed
in reply (April 10), and which was soon afterwards
circulated through the press, is perhaps the
best work from his pen. It is written with deep
feeling, and is, therefore, convincing; learned matter
is not wanting, but the learning is subordinate to<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_48" id="Page_48">48</a></span>
the main object. In the composition of this defense
Manasseh must have had peculiar feelings. He
had come to England the interpreter or representative
of the people of God, expecting speedily to
conquer the sympathy of Christians, and pave the
way for the lordship of Israel over the world,
and now his people was placed at the bar, and he
had to defend it. Hence the tone of this work is
not aggressive and triumphant, but plaintive. He
affirmed that nothing had ever produced a deeper
impression on his mind than the letter addressed
to him with the list of anti-Jewish charges.</p>

<blockquote>

<p>"It reflects upon the credit of a nation, which amongst so many
calumnies, so manifest (and therefore shameful), I dare to pronounce
innocent. And in the first place, I cannot but weep bitterly, and
with much anguish of soul lament, that strange and horrid accusation
of some Christians against the dispersed and afflicted Jews that dwell
among them, when they say (what I tremble to write) that the Jews
are wont to celebrate the Feast of Unleavened Bread, fermenting it
with the blood of some Christians whom they have for that purpose
killed."</p></blockquote>

<p>To this false charge so often made, among others
by Prynne, the greatest part of his defense is
devoted, and it is indeed striking. He traced the
accusation to false witnesses or the confession of
accused persons under torture. The innocence of
the accused was often brought to light, but too late,
when they had been executed. Manasseh confirmed
this by an entertaining story. The physician of a Portuguese
count had been charged by the Inquisition as
a Judaizing Christian. In vain the count pledged
himself for his orthodoxy, he was nevertheless tortured,
and himself confessed that he was a Judaizing
sinner. Subsequently the count, pretending serious
illness, sent for the inquisitor, and in his house, with
doors closed, he commanded him in a threatening
tone to confess in writing that he was a Jew. The
inquisitor refused; then a servant brought in a red-hot
helmet to put upon his head. Thereupon the
inquisitor confessed everything demanded by the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_49" id="Page_49">49</a></span>
count, who took this opportunity to reproach him
with his cruelty and inhumanity.</p>

<p>Manasseh ben Israel besides affirmed with a solemn
oath the absolute falsehood of the oft-repeated
charges as to the use of Christian blood.</p>

<p>After meeting the other accusations against the
Jews, he concludes his defense with a fine prayer and
an address to England:</p>

<blockquote>

<p>"And to the highly honored nation of England I make my most
humble request, that they would read over my arguments impartially,
without prejudice and devoid of all passion, effectually recommending
me to their grace and favor, and earnestly beseeching God that He
would be pleased to hasten the time promised by Zephaniah, wherein
we shall all serve him with one consent, after the same manner, and
shall be all of the same judgment; that as his name is one, so his fear
may be also one, and that we may all see the goodness of the Lord
(blessed for ever!) and the consolations of Zion."</p></blockquote>

<p>This last work of Manasseh ben Israel produced
in England the favorable effect desired. Though
Cromwell, amidst the increasing difficulties of his
government, could not fully carry out the admission
of the Jews, he made a beginning towards it. He
dismissed Manasseh with honorable distinctions, and
granted him a yearly allowance of one hundred
pounds (February 20, 1657) out of the public treasury.
The Jews were not admitted in triumph
through the great portal, but they were let in by
Cromwell through a back door, yet they established
themselves firmly. This was in consequence of an
indictment brought against an immigrant Marrano
merchant, Antonio Robles, that he, a Portuguese
Papist, had illegally engaged in business pursuits in
England, but he was acquitted by the Protector on
the ground that he was not a Catholic, but a Jew.
Thus the residence of such Jews was suffered; they
could therefore drop the mask of Catholicism. Two
respected Marranos, Simon de Caceres and Fernandez
(Isaac) Carvajal, in fact received Cromwell's
permission to open a special burial-ground for the
Sephardic Jews settled in London (1657). In consequence<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_50" id="Page_50">50</a></span>
of this permission it was no longer necessary
to make a show of attending church or of
having their newly-born children baptized. But they
occupied an anomalous position. Being strangers,
and on account of their insignificant numbers, they
lived not exactly on sufferance, but were ignored.
Thus Manasseh ben Israel's endeavors were not
entirely vain. He did not draw the pension
awarded him, nor did he live to witness the coming
up of the seed scattered by him, for on the way
home he died, at Middelburg, probably broken down
by his exertions and the disappointment of his hopes,
even before he reached his family (November, 1657).
His body was afterwards brought to Amsterdam,
and an honorable epitaph was put over his grave.
But his zealous activity, outcome though it was of
Messianic delusions, bore fruit, because it was sincere.
Before he had been dead ten years, Jews
were gradually admitted into England by the monarchy
which succeeded the republic. A community
was assembled which soon became organized, a
room was fitted up in King street as a synagogue,
and Jacob Sasportas, the wanderer from Africa,
Manasseh ben Israel's companion, was chosen rabbi.
The branch community of London took as its model
that of Amsterdam. From this second stronghold,
occupied by Portuguese Jews, afterwards proceeded
the agitation for popular freedom and the liberation
of the Jews.</p>

<p class="center b2">1620&ndash;1660 <span class="smcap smaller">C. E.</span></p>

<p>Judaism, then in its three thousandth year, was like
a rich kernel, covered and concealed by crusts deposited
one upon another, and by extraneous matter,
so that only very few could recognize its true
character. The Sinaitic and prophetic kernel of
thought had long been covered over with the threefold
layer of Sopheric, Mishnic, and Talmudical
explanations and restrictions. Over these, in the
course of centuries, new layers had been formed by
the Gaonic, Spanish, French, German, and Polish
schools, and these layers and strata were enclosed
by an unsightly growth of fungus forms, the mouldy
coating of the Kabbala, which, settling in the gaps
and chinks, grew and ramified. All these new forms
had already the authority of age in their favor, and
were considered inviolable. People no longer asked
what was taught in the fundamental Sinaitic law, or
what was considered of importance by the prophets;
they scarcely regarded what the Talmud decided to
be essential or non-essential; the Rabbinical writers
alone, Joseph Karo and Moses Isserles being the
highest authorities, decided what was Judaism. Besides,
there were superadditions from the Polish
schools, and lastly the Kabbalistic dreams of Isaac<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_52" id="Page_52">52</a></span>
Lurya. The parasitic Kabbala choked the whole
religious life of the Jews. Almost all rabbis and
leaders of Jewish communities, whether in small
Polish towns or in cultivated Amsterdam, the Chacham
Isaac Aboab de Fonseca, as well as Isaiah
Hurwitz, the emigrant to Palestine, were ensnared
by the Kabbala. Gaining influence in the fourteenth
century, contemporaneously with the ban against
science, it had made such giant strides since Isaac
Lurya's death, or rather committed such gigantic
ravages, that nothing could keep it in check.
Lurya's wild notions of the origin, transmigration,
and union of souls, of redemption, and wonder-working,
after his death attracted more and more
adherents into his magic circle, clouding their minds
and narrowing their sympathies.</p>

<p>Lurya's disciples, the lion's whelps, as they boastfully
called themselves, made systematic efforts to effect
conversions, circulated most absurd stories about
Lurya's miracles, gave out that their master's spirit
had come upon them, and shrouded themselves in mystery,
in order to attract greater attention. Chayim
Vital Calabrese had been most prominent, and with
his juggleries deluded the credulous in Palestine and
the neighboring countries (1572&ndash;1620) till his death.
He claimed to be the Ephraimitic Messiah, and
therefore assumed a sort of authority over his fellow-disciples.
In Jerusalem, where he resided for several
years, Vital preached, and had visions, but did
not meet with the recognition he expected. Only
women said that they had seen a pillar of fire or the
prophet Elijah hovering over Vital while he preached.</p>

<p>In Safet, Vital, imitating his master, visited graves,
carried on exorcism of spirits, and other mystic
follies, but not living on good terms with his colleagues,
especially his brother-in-law, Gedaliah
Levi, of whom he was jealous, he settled at
Damascus (1594&ndash;1620), continued his mystifications,
affected great personal importance, as if the salvation<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_53" id="Page_53">53</a></span>
of the world rested on his shoulders, and
preached the speedy appearance of the Messiah,
and his mission to hasten it. Jesus and Mahomet,
repenting their errors, would lay their crowns at
his feet. Ridiculed on account of his wild proceedings,
and declared to be a false prophet, he took
vengeance on his detractors by gross slanders.</p>

<p>In old age he continued his mystical nonsense,
saying that he had been forbidden to reveal his visions,
but this prohibition having been withdrawn, he
could now announce that certain souls living in
human bodies would be united to him&mdash;of course, in
a subordinate capacity&mdash;to bring about the redemption,
one of the souls destined for this mission being
in a foreign country. This was a bait to attract
Kabbala enthusiasts, and thus secure a following.
And enthusiasts hastened from Italy, Germany,
Poland, and other countries to play a Messianic part.
The manuscript notes left by Lurya gave rise to
further frauds. Vital asserted that he alone was in
possession of them, and obtained a decree from the
college at Safet, declaring that no one was authorized
to publish information about Lurya's Kabbala
elsewhere. Kabbalists became the more anxious
to possess this incomparable treasure. Chayim
Vital's brother, Moses Vital, took advantage of their
eagerness to make a good business of it. During
an illness of his brother's, he caused the writings
found at his house to be copied, and sold them at a
high price. After his recovery, Chayim Vital
affirmed that the writings stolen were not the genuine
ones; these he would never publish. He is
said in his will to have directed them to be laid in his
grave. Nevertheless, after his death, his son, Samuel
Vital, sold Luryan Kabbalistic revelations, and
published his father's dreams and visions in a
separate work. An immigrant Marrano from Portugal,
a devotee of the Kabbala, asserted that he had
found the best collection in Vital's grave.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_54" id="Page_54">54</a></span>
After this time a regular search was made after
the Kabbala of Lurya and Vital. Whoever was in
possession of copies, and offered them for sale or
publication, found ready purchasers. Messengers
were employed to give this fraud currency in the
Jewish communities. Israel Saruk, or Sarug, a German,
one of Lurya's disciples, introduced the Luryan
Kabbala into Italy, gained many adherents for it,
and much money for himself. His account of his
master's miracles offended the taste of very few.
From Italy he betook himself to Holland, and there
gained a disciple who knew how to give the Kabbalistic
frenzy a philosophic complexion. Alonzo, or
Abraham, de Herrera (died 1639), a descendant of
the Great Captain, the viceroy of Naples, was introduced
by Saruk into the mysteries of the Luryan
Kabbala. Having lived a Christian during the
greatest part of his life, he was more familiar with
non-Jewish philosophy than with Jewish literature;
therefore it was easy to deceive him into taking
dross for gold. He felt clearly that Lurya's Kabbala
betrayed resemblances to Neoplatonic philosophy,
but this disturbed De Herrera little, or rather,
it confirmed the Kabbalistic teaching, and he endeavored
to explain one by the other. Finding it
impossible to reconcile the two systems, he, too, fell
into idle talk and rambling expressions. Abraham
de Herrera, who, as has been stated, became a Jew
at a ripe age, could not learn Hebrew, and hence
had his two Kabbalistic works, the "House of God"
and the "Gate of Heaven," translated by the Amsterdam
preacher Isaac Aboab from Spanish into
Hebrew, and in his will set apart a considerable
sum of money for their publication. The author
and translator doubtless thought that they had rendered
an inexpressibly great service to Judaism.
But by the meretricious splendor which these works
imparted to the Kabbala, they blinded the superficial
minds of the average Portuguese Jews, who, in spite<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_55" id="Page_55">55</a></span>
of their knowledge of classical literature and European
culture, abandoned themselves to the delusions
of the Kabbala. Manasseh ben Israel and all
his older and younger contemporaries in Holland
paid homage to mysticism, and had no doubt of its
truth and divinity.</p>

<p>In Germany and Poland two men, half Polish and
half German, brought Lurya's Kabbala into high estimation:
Isaiah Hurwitz (Sheloh), called the Holy,
and Naphtali Frankfurter, to whom we may perhaps
add the credulous Solomon, or Shlomel, of Moravia,
who glorified the silliest stories of wonders performed
by Isaac Lurya, Vital, and their circle, in letters
sent to Germany and Poland, which were eagerly
read and circulated.</p>

<p>However, in this thick unsightly crust over-spreading
the Kabbala, some rifts and chinks
appeared, which indicated disintegration. Here
and there were found unprejudiced men, who
felt and expressed doubts as to the truth of
Judaism in its later Rabbinical and Kabbalistic
form. Many went further, and included Talmudical
interpretation. Others advanced from
doubt to certainty, and proceeded more or less
openly against the existing form of Judaism. Such
inquirers, of course, were not to be met with among
German and Polish, nor among Asiatic Jews; these
considered every letter in the Talmud and Zohar,
every law in the code (Shulchan Aruch) as the inviolable
word of God. The doubters were only in
Italian and Portuguese communities, which had relations
with educated circles. A pious adherent of
tradition, Immanuel Aboab, of Portuguese origin,
who had long resided in Italy, felt called upon to
compose a defense of the Judaism of the Talmud
and the rabbis (Nomologia, composed 1616&ndash;1625),
showing an unbroken chain of exponents of true
tradition down to his own time, a well-meant, but
not very convincing work. The confused Kabbalist<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_56" id="Page_56">56</a></span>
Naphtali Frankfurter complained of his contemporaries
who ridiculed the Talmud. Three or four
gifted investigators more or less frankly revealed
the scepticism working beneath the surface. These
three men, differing in character, mode of life, and
position, were Uriel Acosta, Judah Leo Modena, and
Joseph Delmedigo; we may perhaps add Simone
Luzzatto to the list. They endeavored to lay bare
the disadvantages and weaknesses of existing Judaism;
but not one of them was able to suggest or
apply a remedy.</p>

<p>Uriel da Costa (Gabriel Acosta, born about 1590,
died April, 1640) was an original character, whose
inward unrest and external course of life could not
but bring him into conflict with Judaism. He was
descended from a Portuguese Marrano family at
Oporto, whose members had been made sincere
believers in Christ by the terrors of the Inquisition.
His father, at least, who belonged to the higher
classes in Portugal, had become a strict Catholic.
Young Gabriel learnt ecclesiasticism and the accomplishments
of a cavalier from his father, was, like
him, a good rider, and entered upon a course of
education, limited, indeed, but sufficient for that time.
He adopted the only career open to young Portuguese
of the upper middle class, by means of which
the gifted could rise to distinction, and to a certain
equality with the nobility. He was prepared for the
law, a study which might pave the way to the second
rank, the clerical. In his youth the Jesuits had
already obtained powerful influence over men's
minds, and their methods of exciting the imagination
and subduing the intellect by depicting everlasting
damnation and the punishments of hell had proved
effectual. Nothing but punctilious, mechanical worship
and continual confession could overcome the
terrors of hell.</p>

<p>Gabriel da Costa, in spite of his punctilious
ecclesiasticism, did not feel quieted in his conscience.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_57" id="Page_57">57</a></span>
Daily mechanical exercises failed to influence his
mind, and continual confession to obtain absolution
from the lips of the priest pleased him less as he
became more mature. Somewhat of the subtle Jewish
spirit remained in his nature, and shook the
strongly built Catholic system of belief to its foundations.
The more deeply he plunged into the Catholic
Jesuitic teaching, the more did doubts trouble him,
and disturb his conscience. However, he accepted
a semi-ecclesiastical office as chief treasurer to an
abbey about 1615. To end his doubts, he investigated
the oldest records of Holy Scripture. The
prophets were to solve the riddles which the Roman
Catholic Church doctrines daily presented to him.
The fresh spirit which breathed from out of the Old
Testament, disfigured though it was in its Latin
guise, brought repose to his mind. The doctrines
of Judaism appeared the more certain, as they were
recognized by the New Testament and the Church,
while those of Catholicism were rejected by Judaism;
in the one case there was unanimity, in the other,
contradiction. Da Costa formed the resolution to
forsake Catholicism and return to Judaism. Of an
impulsive, passionate temperament, he sought to
carry his resolution into effect quickly. With great
caution he communicated his intention to his mother
and brothers&mdash;his father was already dead&mdash;and
they also resolved to expose themselves to the
danger of secret emigration, to leave their hearth and
home, give up a respected position in society, and
exchange the certain present for an uncertain future.
In spite of the Argus-eyed espionage of Marranos
by the Inquisition and the secular authorities, the
Da Costa family succeeded in gaining a vessel and
escaping to Amsterdam (about 1617&ndash;18). Gabriel
da Costa and his brothers were admitted to the
covenant of Abraham, and Gabriel changed his
name to Uriel.</p>

<p>Of a hot-blooded nature, an enthusiast whose<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_58" id="Page_58">58</a></span>
imagination overpowered his judgment, Uriel da
Costa had formed for himself an ideal of Judaism
which he expected to meet with in Amsterdam, but
which had never been realized. He thought to see
biblical conditions, supported by pure Pentateuchal
laws, realized in the young Amsterdam community,
and to find an elevation of mind which would at once
clear up the puzzles that the Catholic Church could
not solve. What the Catholic confessors could not
offer, he thought that he would be able to obtain
from the rabbis of Amsterdam. Da Costa had built
religious and dogmatic castles in the air, and was
annoyed not to meet with them in the world of
reality. He soon found that the religious life of the
Amsterdam community and its established laws did
not agree with Mosaic or Pentateuchal precepts, but
were often opposed to them. As he had made great
sacrifices for his convictions, he thought that he had
the right to express his opinion freely, and point to the
gap which existed between biblical and Rabbinical
Judaism. He was deeply wounded, embittered, and
irritated, and allowed himself to be completely overpowered
by his feelings. He did not stop at mere
words, but regulated his conduct accordingly, openly
disregarded religious usages, and thought that in
opposing the ordinances of the "Pharisees" (as,
in the language of the Church, he called the rabbis),
he was recommending himself to the favor of God.
He thereby brought upon himself unpleasantnesses
destined to end tragically. Were the Amsterdam
Jews, who had suffered so much for their religion,
quietly to see one of their members openly assail
and ridicule Judaism, become so dear to them?
Those born and brought up in the land of the Inquisition
had no idea of toleration and indulgence for
the conviction of others. The rabbis, perhaps Isaac
Uziel and Joseph Pardo, threatened Da Costa with
excommunication, <i>i. e.</i>, expulsion from the religious
community and severance of all relations with it, if<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_59" id="Page_59">59</a></span>
he persisted in transgressing the religious ordinances
of Judaism. This opposition only served to
increase Da Costa's passion; he was ill-content to
have purchased new fetters by the sacrifices he had
made. He continued to disregard the laws in force,
and was eventually excommunicated. Uriel's relatives,
who had more easily adapted themselves to
the new faith, avoided him, and spoke not a word to
him. Thus Da Costa stood alone in the midst of a
great city. Separated from his race, friends, and
relatives, a stranger amongst the Christian inhabitants
of Amsterdam, whose language he had not yet
learnt, and thrown upon himself, he fell more and more
into subtle speculation. Acting under excessive irritation,
he resolved to publish a work hostile to
the Judaism of the day, and bring out particularly
the glaring contrast between it and the Bible. As
irrefragable proof, he intended to emphasize that the
former recognized only bodily punishments and
rewards, and taught nothing as to the immortality of
the soul. But he discovered that the Bible itself
observes silence about a purely spiritual future life,
and does not bring within the circle of religion the
idea of a soul separated from the body. In short,
his investigations led him away not only from Catholicism
and Rabbinical Judaism, but from the Bible
itself. It is not known how it was circulated that
the excommunicated Da Costa intended to give
public offense, but he was anticipated. Samuel da
Silva, a Jewish physician, in 1623 published a work
in the Portuguese language, entitled "A Treatise on
the Immortality of the Soul, in order to confute the
Ignorance of a certain Opponent, who in Delusion
affirms many Errors." In the course of the work
the author plainly named Uriel, and described him
as "blind and incapable." Da Costa thought his
opponents, especially the rabbis, had hired Da Silva's
pen to attack him. Hence he hastened to publish
his work, also in Portuguese (1624&ndash;1625), entitled<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_60" id="Page_60">60</a></span>
"An Examination of the Pharisaic Traditions, compared
with the written Laws, and Reply to the Slanderer
Samuel da Silva." The fact of his calling his
opponent a slanderer shows his confusion, for he
actually asserted what Da Silva had reproached him
with, that the soul is not immortal. As he now had
unequivocally declared his breach with Judaism, he
had to take the consequences. Before, he had been
openly scorned by young people in the street as an
excommunicant, a heretic, an Epicurean (in the Talmudical
sense); he had been pelted with stones, disturbed
and annoyed in his own house (as he thought,
at the instigation of the rabbis). Now, after the
appearance of his work, the official representatives
of the Amsterdam community complained to the
magistrates that by denying the immortality of the
soul, he had attacked not only the teaching of Judaism,
but also of Christianity, and had published
errors. Da Costa was arrested, kept for several
days in prison, at last fined 300 gulden, and his work
condemned to the flames. The freest state of that
time believed that it had the right to keep watch over
and limit freedom of thought and writing; its distinction
was merely that it kindled no funeral piles for human
beings. Da Costa's brethren in race could not
have persecuted him very severely, for he was able to
bear excommunication during the long space of fifteen
years. Only his isolation was a heavy burden;
he could not endure to be avoided by his family as
one infected with the plague. Da Costa was not a
strong-minded man, a thinker of the first order, who
could live happily in his world of ideas as in boundless
space, unconcerned about the outer world, and
glad of his solitary freedom; he could not do without
the world. He had invested his capital with one of
his brothers, and he thought that it would be endangered
if he continued the war against the community.
He thought of taking a wife, which was impossible
so long as he was excommunicated. Hence he at<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_61" id="Page_61">61</a></span>
last yielded to the urgency of his relatives to become
reconciled with the community. He was willing, as
he said, "to be an ape among apes." He confessed
Judaism with his lips at the very time when he had in
his heart thoroughly fallen away from it.</p>

<p>Da Costa, in his philosophical inquiries, had come
upon a new discovery. Judaism, even in its pure
biblical form, could not have been of divine origin,
because it contradicts nature in many points, and
God, the Creator of nature, can not contradict Himself
in revelation. He cannot command a principle
in the Law, if He has implanted in nature an opposing
principle. This was the first step to the deistic
tendency then appearing in France and the Netherlands,
which acknowledged God only in nature, not
in the moral law, and in religious and political development.
Da Costa's theory supposed a religion of
nature inborn in man, which produced and built
up the moral law, and culminated in the love of
members of a family to one another. The best in
Judaism and other revealed religions is borrowed
from the religion of nature. The latter knows only
love and union; the others, on the contrary, arm
parents and children against one another on account
of the faith. This theory was the suggestion of his
bitterness, because his relatives avoided him, and
showed him but little consideration. Da Costa appears
to have put forward as the religion of nature
what the Talmud calls the Noachian commandments.</p>

<p>In spite of his complete falling away from Judaism,
he resolved, as he himself states, on the intervention
of his nephew, and after passing fifteen
years in excommunication (about 1618&ndash;1633), to
alter his course of life and actions, make a confession,
or rather put his signature to such a document,
an act of what he himself describes as thoroughgoing
hypocrisy, designed to purchase repose and
comfort, at the cost of conviction. But his passionate<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_62" id="Page_62">62</a></span>
nature robbed him of both. He could not
impose renunciation upon himself to conform to the
religious usages of Judaism, but transgressed them
immediately after his penitent confession. He was
detected by one of his relatives, and they all, especially
the nephew who had brought about the reconciliation,
were so embittered that they persecuted
him even more relentlessly than those less nearly
connected with him. They again renounced intercourse
with him, prevented his marriage, and are
said to have injured him in his property. Through
his passionate hatred of Judaism, which he had confessed
with his lips, he committed an act of folly
which exposed his true sentiments. Two Christians,
an Italian and a Spaniard, had come from
London to Amsterdam to attach themselves to
Judaism. When they consulted Uriel da Costa on
the subject, he gave a frightful picture of the Jewish
form of religion, warned them against laying a
heavy yoke on their necks, and advised them to
continue in their own faith. Contrary to promise,
the two Christians betrayed Da Costa's remarks on
Judaism to the leaders of the community. The war
between them and him broke out afresh. The rabbis
summoned him a second time before their tribunal,
set before him his religious transgressions, and
declared that he could escape a second severe
excommunication only by submitting to a solemn
penance in public. More from a sense of honor
than from conviction he refused this penance, and
so was a second time laid under the ban, much more
severe than the first, in which condition he continued
for seven years. During this time he was
treated by the members of the community with
contempt, and even spat upon. His brothers and
nephews behaved with the greatest severity towards
him, because they thought by that means to force
him to repentance. They reckoned on his helplessness
and weakness, and they did not reckon amiss.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_63" id="Page_63">63</a></span>
Da Costa meanwhile had reached middle age,
had been made submissive by conflicts and excitement,
and longed for repose. By process of law,
which he had instituted against the Amsterdam
authorities, he could obtain nothing, because he
could not put his complaints into a tangible form;
he consented, therefore, to everything demanded
for his humiliation. His public penance was to be
very severe. There was no definite prescription on
the subject in the religious Code, which, in fact, is
opposed in spirit to public penance; the sinner is
not to confess aloud his transgressions against
religion, but in silence to God. Judaism, from its
origin, objected to confession and the mechanical
avowal of sins. For this reason it remained for the
college of rabbis to appoint a form of penance.
The Amsterdam rabbis and the communal council,
consisting of Marranos, adopted as a model the
gloomy form of the tribunal of the Inquisition.</p>

<p>As soon as Da Costa had consented to his humiliation,
he was led into one of the synagogues, which
was full of men and women. There was to be a
sort of auto-da-f√©, and the greatest possible publicity
was given to his penance because the scandal had
been public. He had to ascend a stage and read
out his confession of sins: that he had desecrated
the Sabbath, violated the dietary laws, denied articles
of faith, and advised persons not to adopt
Judaism. He solemnly declared that he resolved
to be no longer guilty of such offenses, but to live
as a true Jew. On a whisper from the first rabbi,
probably Saul Morteira, he went to a corner of the
synagogue, stripped as far as the girdle, and received
thirty-nine stripes with a scourge. Then he
was obliged to sit on the ground, after which the
ban was removed. Not yet having satisfied the
authorities, he had to stretch himself out on the
threshold of the synagogue, that those present
might step over him. It was certainly an excessive<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_64" id="Page_64">64</a></span>
penance which was imposed upon him, not from a
desire of persecution or vengeance, but from religious
scrupulousness and mimicry of Catholic forms.
No wonder that the disgrace and humiliation deeply
wounded Da Costa, who had consented to the punishment,
not from inward repentance, but from
exhaustion. The public disgrace had shaken his
whole being, and suggested thoughts of revenge.
Instead of pitying the rabbis as the creatures of
historical conditions, he hated them with a glowing
feeling of revenge as the refuse of mankind, and as
if they thought of nothing but deception, lying, and
wickedness. His wounded sense of honor and
heated imagination saw in the Jews of the Amsterdam
community, perhaps in all the Jews on the
earth's surface, his personal, venomous foes, and in
Judaism an institution to stir up men to hatred and
persecution. Thinking that he was surrounded by
bitter enemies, and feeling too weak for a fresh
conflict, he resolved to die, but at the same time to
take vengeance on his chief persecutor, his brother
(or cousin). To excite the sympathy of his contemporaries
and posterity, he wrote his autobiography
and confession, which, however, contain no new
thoughts, only bitterness and furious attacks against
the Jews, intermingled with fresh aspersions of them
in the eyes of Christians: that even at this time
they would have crucified Jesus, and that the state
ought not to grant them freedom of religious profession.
This document, drawn up amidst preparations
for death, breathed nothing but revenge
against his enemies. After he had finished his impassioned
testament, he loaded two pistols, and fired
one at his relative, who was passing his house. He
missed his aim, so he shut the door of his room, and
killed himself with the other weapon (April, 1640).</p>

<p>On opening his residence after the report of the
shot, they found on the table his autobiography,
"An Example of Human Life," in which he brought<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_65" id="Page_65">65</a></span>
Jews and Judaism to the bar, and with pathetic sentences
described them as his excited imagination in
the last hour suggested. By this act and legacy Da
Costa showed that he suffered himself to be overpowered
by his feelings rather than guided by reason.
He was neither a thinker nor a wise man, nor
was his a manly character. As his system of
thought was not well balanced, leading him to
oppose what existed as false and bad, because it
was in his way, he left no lasting impression. His
Jewish contemporaries persisted in stubborn silence
about him, as if they wished his memory to fall into
oblivion. He acted like a boy who breaks the windows
in an old decaying building, and thus creates a
draught.</p>

<p>The second seditious thinker of this time, Leo
(Judah) ben Isaac Modena (born 1571, died 1649),
was of another stamp, and was reared in different
surroundings. Leo Modena was descended from a
cultivated family which migrated to Modena, in
Italy, on the expulsion of the Jews from France,
and whose ancestors, from lack of intellectual clearness,
despite their education, fostered every kind of
superstition and fanciful idea.</p>

<p>Leo Modena possessed this family peculiarity in
a high degree. He was a marvelous child. In his
third year he could read a portion from the prophets;
in his tenth, he delivered a sort of sermon; in
his thirteenth, he wrote a clever dialogue on the
question of the lawfulness of playing with cards and
dice, and composed an elegy on the death of the
teacher of his youth, Moses Basula, in Hebrew and
Italian verses having the same sound&mdash;a mere
trifle, to be sure, but which at a riper age pleased
him so well that he had it printed. But the marvelous
child did not develop into a marvelous man,
into a personage of prominence or distinction.
Modena became, however, the possessor of astonishingly
varied knowledge. As he pursued all sorts<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_66" id="Page_66">66</a></span>
of occupations to support himself, viz., those of
preacher, teacher of Jews and Christians, reader
of prayers, interpreter, writer, proof-reader, book-seller,
broker, merchant, rabbi, musician, match-maker,
and manufacturer of amulets, without ever
attaining to a fixed position, so he studied many
departments of knowledge without specially distinguishing
himself in any. He grasped the whole of
biblical, Talmudic, and Rabbinic literature, was well
read in Christian theological works, understood
something of philosophy and physics, was able to
write Hebrew and Italian verses&mdash;in short, he had
read everything accessible through the medium of
three languages, Hebrew, Latin, and Italian. He
remembered what he read, for he possessed an excellent
memory, invented a method of sharpening
it still more, and wrote a book on this subject. But
Leo Modena had no delight either in knowledge or
poetry; neither had value for him except so far as
they brought bread. He preached, wrote books
and verses, translated and commented, all to earn
money, which he wasted in card-playing, a passion
which he theoretically considered most culpable, but
in practice could not overcome. At the age of sixty
he acquired property, but lost it more quickly than
he had acquired it, squandering 100 ducats in
scarcely a month, and twice as much in the following
year. Knowledge had not enlightened and elevated
him, had had no influence on his principles. Leo
Modena possessed neither genius nor character.
Dissatisfied with himself and his lot, in constant
disquiet on account of his fondness for gaming, and
battling with need, he became a prey to doubt.
Religion had no power over his heart; he preached
to others, but not to himself. Unbelief and superstition
waged continual war within him. He envied
na√Øve believers, who, in their simplicity, are undisturbed
by doubt, expect, and, as Leo added, obtain
happiness from scrupulously observing the ceremonies.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_67" id="Page_67">67</a></span>
Inquirers, on the other hand, are obliged to
struggle for their faith and the happiness dependent
upon it, and are tortured incessantly by pangs of
doubt. He had no real earnestness nor true conviction,
or rather, according to his humor and mood,
he had a different one every day, without being a
hypocrite. Hence he could say of himself, "I do
not belong to the class of painted people, my outward
conduct always corresponds with my feelings."</p>

<p>Leo Modena was sincere at each moment. On
one day he broke a lance for the Talmud and Rabbinical
Judaism, on the next, condemned them
utterly. He disapproved of gaming, and grieved
that the stars had given him this unfortunate propensity,
for he believed also in astrology; yet he
prepared a Talmudical decision defending it.
When the Venetian college of rabbis pronounced
the ban on cards and dice, he pointed out that gaming
was permissible by Rabbinical principles, and
that the ban had no justification. His disciple,
Joseph Chamiz, a physician and mystic, once asked
him his opinion on the Kabbalistic transmigration of
souls. Modena replied that as a rule he would profess
belief in the doctrine even though convinced of
its folly, in order not to be pronounced a heretic and
a fool, but to him he was willing to express his sincere
and true views. Thereupon Leo Modena prepared
a work to expose the absurdity and inconsistency
with Judaism of the belief in transmigration
of souls. But so feebly was this conviction rooted
in his nature that, having had an extraordinary experience,
he again, at least for a time, believed in
the transmigration of souls, a favorite theory of the
Kabbala.</p>

<p>The Ghetto of Venice must have been a totally
different place from that of Frankfort, or Prague, or
from the Polish-Jewish quarters, since it was possible
for men like Leo Modena, with his peculiar
principles, and Simone Luzzatto, as little of a genuine<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_68" id="Page_68">68</a></span>
rabbi, to be members of the rabbinate. In the
largest Italian community next to that of Rome,
consisting of 6,000 souls, there were cultivated Jews
interested in Italian and general European culture,
and enjoying not only social, but also literary intercourse
with Christian society. The walls of the
Ghetto formed no partition between the Jewish and
the Christian population. At this time, in the age
of Shakespeare, there was no Shylock, certainly not
in Venice, who would have stipulated as payment
for his loan a pound of flesh from his Christian
debtor. The people properly so called, workmen,
sailors, and porters, precisely in Venice, were milder
and more friendly towards Jews than in other Christian
cities. Jewish manufacturers employed 4,000
Christian workmen in the lagoon city, so that their
existence depended on their Jewish employers alone.
At the time of a devastating pestilence, when, even
in this well policed city, the reins of government
became slacker and looser, and threatened to fall
from the hands of those in power, Jewish capitalists
voluntarily offered their money to the state to
prevent embarrassment. There were not a few
among them who vied with the cultivated classes
among the Christians in the elegant use of the
Italian language in speaking and writing, and in
making good verses. Besides the two rabbis, Leo
Modena and Simone Luzzatto, two Jewish poetesses,
Deborah Ascarelli and Sarah Copia Sullam, are
illustrations thereof. The first, the wife of Joseph
Ascarelli, a respected Venetian, translated Hebrew
hymns into elegant Italian strophes, and also composed
original verses. A Jewish-Italian poet addressed
her in verses thus: "Others may sing of
great trophies, thou glorifiest thy people."</p>

<p>The graceful and spiritual Sarah Copia (born
about 1600, died 1641) excited a certain amount of
attention in her time. She was an original poetess
and thinker, and her gifts, as well as her grace,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_69" id="Page_69">69</a></span>
brought her temptations and dangers. The only
child of a wealthy father, Simon Copia (Coppio) in
Venice, who loved her tenderly, she yielded to her
inclination for instruction, and devoted herself to
science and literature. To this inclination she
remained true even after her marriage with Jacob
Sullam. Sarah Copia Sullam surpassed her sex and
even men of her age in knowledge. She delighted
in beauty, and breathed out her inspirations in
rhythmic, elegant verses. Young, attractive, with a
noble heart and a penetrating understanding, striving
after high ideals, and a favorite of the muses, Sarah
Sullam fascinated the old as well as the young.
Her musical, well-trained voice excited admiration.
When an elderly Italian priest, Ansaldo Ceba, at
Genoa, published an heroic poem in Italian strophes,
of which the scriptural Esther was the heroine, Sarah
was so delighted, that she addressed an enthusiastic
anonymous letter full of praise to the author (1618).
It pleased her to see a Jewish heroine, her ideal,
celebrated in verses, and the attention of the cultivated
public directed to Jewish antiquity. She
hoped that thereby the prejudice against the Jews
of the day would vanish. Sarah did not conceal
from the poet that she always carried his poetical
creations about with her, and at night put his book
under her pillow. Instead of finding satisfaction in
the sincere homage of a pure woman's soul, Ceba,
in his zeal for conversion, thought only of bringing
her over to Christianity. When he heard Sarah's
beauty extolled by the servant whom he sent with
presents and verses, love for her awoke in him.
This was increased by her sending him her portrait,
accompanied by enthusiastic verses in the exaggerated
style of that time, in which she said: "I carry
my idol in my heart, and I wish everyone to worship
him." But the beautiful Venetian Jewess did not
allow herself to be entrapped. She held firmly to
her Jewish beliefs, and unfolded to her priestly friend<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_70" id="Page_70">70</a></span>
the reasons that induced her to prefer Judaism. In
vain did Ceba, by tenderness, reproofs, and sentimental
languishing, with intimations of his speedy
end, and his longing to be united with her in heaven,
endeavor to make her waver in her conviction.
When he begged permission to pray for her salvation,
she granted his request on condition that she
might pray for his conversion to Judaism.</p>

<p>Her exceptional position as poetess, and her connection
with Christians of high rank, brought her
renown, not unattended by annoyances. Slanderous
fellow-believers spread the report, that she
esteemed the principles of Judaism but lightly,
and did not fully believe in their divinity. An
unprincipled Christian priest, Balthasar Bonifaccio,
who later occupied the position of bishop, published
a work accusing the Jewess Sarah Sullam of denying
the immortality of the soul. Such a charge
might in Catholic Venice have had other effects than
that against Uriel da Costa in free-thinking, Protestant
Amsterdam. Not merely fine and imprisonment
might have been inflicted, but the Inquisition
might have sentenced her to the dungeon, to torture,
and perhaps even the stake. Hardly recovered
from illness, she wrote (1621) a manifesto on the
immortality of the soul, full of ripe dialectics, noble
courage, and crushing force, against her slanderous
accuser. The dedication to her deceased father is
touching, and still more touching is her fervent
psalm-like prayer in melodious Italian verses. The
consciousness that she, a woman and Jewess, could
not rely on her own strength, but only on help from
above, spreads a halo about her memory. The end
of this affair is not known. Ceba's epic "Esther"
probably induced Leo Modena to translate Solomon
Usque's tragedy on the same subject from Spanish
into Italian verse; he dedicated it to Sarah Copia,
whose epitaph he composed in melodious Hebrew
verses.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_71" id="Page_71">71</a></span>
Leo Modena also had frequent intercourse with
Christians. His peculiar nature, his communicative
disposition, and great learning, as also his wit and
his fondness for gaming, opened the doors of Christian
circles to the volatile rabbi. Christian disciples
sat at his feet. The French bishop Jacob Plantavicius,
and the half-crazed Christian Kabbalist Jacob
Gaffarelli, were his pupils. Nobles and learned
men corresponded with him, and permitted him to
inscribe his works to them with flattering dedications.
Leo Modena held in Italy nearly the same
position as Manasseh ben Israel in Holland. In the
conversation of serious men and in the merry circle
of gamesters, he often heard the ceremonies of
Judaism ridiculed as childish nonsense (Lex Jud√¶orum
lex puerorum). At first he defended his
religion, but gradually was forced to admit one thing
and another in Judaism to be defective and ridiculous;
he was ashamed to be so thoroughly a Jew
as to justify all consequences. His necessities led
him, on pressure from Christian friends, to render
single portions, and at last the whole, of the Jewish
code accessible to the Christian public in the Italian
language. An English lord paid him for the work,
with the intention of giving it to King James I, who
made pretensions to extensive learning. Afterwards
his Christian disciple Gaffarelli had this work,
entitled "The Hebrew Rites," printed in Paris, and
dedicated it to the French ambassador at Venice.
In this work, eagerly read by Christians, Leo Modena,
like Ham, uncovered his father's nakedness,
exposed the inner sanctuary of the Jews to prying
and mocking eyes. To the uninitiated, that which
within the Jewish circle was a matter for reverence
could not but appear petty, silly, and absurd. Leo
Modena explained what ceremonies and statutes
Jews employ in connection with their dwellings,
clothing, household furniture, up-rising and lying
down, physical functions, and in the synagogues and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_72" id="Page_72">72</a></span>
schools. Involuntarily the author associated himself
with the despisers of Judaism, which he as rabbi had
practiced and taught. He showed that he was conscious
of this:</p>

<blockquote>

<p>"While writing I in fact forgot that I am a Jew, and considered
myself a simple, impartial narrator. However, I do not deny that I
have taken pains to avoid ridicule on account of the numerous ceremonies,
but I had no intention to defend and palliate, because I wished
only to communicate, not convince."</p></blockquote>

<p>However, it would be an error to infer from this
that Leo Modena had at heart completely broken
with Rabbinical Judaism. He was, as has been
stated, not a man of firm and lasting convictions.
Almost at the same time when he exposed the rites
of Judaism to the Christian public, he composed a
defense of them and oral teaching in general against
attacks from the Jewish side. A Hamburg Jew of
Marrano descent had raised eleven points to show
the falsehood of Talmudic tradition. Of these
arguments some are important, others frivolous.
The Hamburg sceptic laid chief stress on the point
that Talmudic and Rabbinic ordinances are additions
to Pentateuchal Judaism, and the Pentateuch
had expressly forbidden additions of this sort. At
the wish of certain Portuguese Jews, Leo Modena
confuted these objections, raised by a sciolist. His
confutation was a feeble performance, and contains
nothing new. With Leo Modena one never knew
whether he was earnest in his belief or his unbelief.
As in youth he had brought forward reasons for and
against games of chance, had finally condemned
them, and nevertheless freely engaged in them, so
he behaved with regard to Talmudical Judaism.
He attacked it, defended it, made it appear ridiculous,
and yet practiced it with a certain degree of
honesty.</p>

<p>Some years after his vindication of Talmudical
Judaism against the Hamburg sceptic he composed
the best work (1624) that issued from his active<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_73" id="Page_73">73</a></span>
pen. On the one side it was a weighty attack on
Rabbinical Judaism, such as had hardly been made
even by Christians and Karaites, on the other side,
an impressive defense of it. He did not venture
to put his own name to the heavy charges against
Judaism, but used a fictitious name. The part
which contains the attacks he called "The Fool's
Voice" (Kol Sachal), and the defense, "The Roaring
of the Lion" (Shaagath Aryeh). Leo Modena
allotted to two characters his own duplex nature,
his varying convictions. He makes the opponent
of Judaism express himself with a boldness such as
Uriel da Costa might have envied. Not only did
he undermine the Rabbinical Judaism of the Talmud,
but also biblical Judaism, the Sinaitic revelation, and
the Torah. But the blows which Leo Modena,
under the name of Ibn-Raz of Alkala, in an attack
of unbelief, inflicted on oral teaching, or Talmudical
Judaism, were most telling.</p>

<p>He premises that no form of religion maintains
itself in its original state and purity according to the
views of its founder. Judaism, also, although the
lawgiver expressly warned his followers against
adding anything, had many additions thrust upon it.
Interpretation and comment had altered many
things in it. Ibn-Raz (or Leo Modena in his unbelieving
mood) examines with a critical eye Jacob
Asheri's code, and at each point marks the additions
made by the rabbis to the original code, and where
they had weakened and distorted it. He goes so
far as to make proposals how to clear Judaism of
excrescences, in order to restore genuine, ancient,
biblical, spiritual Judaism. This was the first attempt
at reform: a simplification of the prayers and
synagogue service, abolition of rites, omission of the
second day of the festivals, relaxation of Sabbath,
festival, Passover, and even Day of Atonement laws.
Every one was to fast only according to his bodily
and spiritual powers. He wished to see the ritual<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_74" id="Page_74">74</a></span>
for slaughtering animals and the laws as to food set
aside, or simplified. The prohibition to drink wine
with those of other creeds made Jews ridiculous, as
also did the strictness against alleged idolatry. All
this, observed Ibn-Raz, or Leo Modena, at the
close, does not exhaust the subject; it is only a
specimen of the evil of Rabbinical Judaism. He
knew well that he would be pronounced a heretic,
and persecuted on account of his frank criticism,
but if he could open the eyes of a single reader, he
would consider himself amply rewarded.</p>

<p>Had Leo Modena been in earnest with this bold
view, which would have revolutionized the Judaism
of his day, had he uttered it to the world with deep
conviction, he would no doubt have produced great
commotion in Judaism. But criticism of the Talmud
was only mental amusement for him; he did not
intend to engage in an actual conflict. He composed
a reply with as little sincerity, and let both
attack and defense slumber among his papers.</p>

<p>Leo Modena was more in earnest with the attack
on the Kabbala, which had become burdensome and
repulsive to him. He felt impelled to discharge
destructive arrows against it, and this he did with
masterly skill. He called the anti-Kabbalistic work,
which he dedicated to his disciple Joseph Chamiz,
a Luryan enthusiast, "The Roaring Lion" (Ari
Noham). From many sides he threw light on the
deceptions, the absurdity, and the falsehood of the
Kabbala and its fundamental source, the Zohar.
Neither this work nor his attacks on Talmudical
Judaism were published by him: the author was not
anxious to labor in either direction. To a late age
he continued his irregular life, without striving after
real improvement. Leo Modena died, weary of the
conflict, not with gods (<i>i. e.</i>, ideas) and men, but
with himself, and of the troubles which he had
brought upon himself.</p>

<p>Apparently similar, yet differing fundamentally<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_75" id="Page_75">75</a></span>
from him, was the third burrower of this period:
Joseph Solomon Delmedigo (born 1591, died 1655).
Scion of an old and noble family, in whose midst
science and the Talmud were cultivated, and great-grandson
on the female side of the clear thinker
Elias del Medigo, he but slightly resembled the
other members of his house. His father, a rabbi in
Candia, had not only initiated him into Talmudic
literature, but also made him learn Greek. Later
Delmedigo acquired the literary languages of the
time, Italian and Spanish in addition to Latin. The
knowledge of languages, however, was only a means
to an end. At the University of Padua he obtained
his scientific education; he showed decided inclination
for mathematics and astronomy, and could
boast of having as his tutor the great Galileo, the
discoverer of the laws of the heavens, the martyr to
natural science. By him he was made acquainted
with the Copernican system of the sun and the
planets. Neither Delmedigo nor any believing Jew
labored under the delusion that the stability of the
sun and the motion of the earth were in contradiction
to the Bible, and therefore heretical. Delmedigo
also studied medicine, but only as a profession;
his favorite subject continued to be mathematics.
He enriched his mind with all the treasures
of knowledge, more varied even than that of
Leo Modena, to whom during his residence in Italy
he clung as a disciple to his master. In the circle
of Jewish-Italian semi-freethinkers he lost the simple
faith which he had brought from home, and doubts
as to the truth of tradition stole upon him, but he
was not sufficiently animated by a desire for truth
either to overcome these doubts and become settled
in the early belief to which he had been brought up,
or unsparingly to expose the false elements in Jewish
tradition. Joseph Delmedigo was as little
formed to be a martyr to his convictions as Leo
Modena, the latter by reason of fickleness, the
former, of insincerity.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_76" id="Page_76">76</a></span>
With doubt in his heart he returned to his home
in Candia, and gave offense by his free mode of
thought, especially by his preference for secular
knowledge. He made enemies, who are said to
have persecuted him, and was obliged to leave his
native land. Then began a migratory life, which
drove him from city to city, like his model Ibn-Ezra.
Like him, he made friends with the Karaites
wherever he met them, and they thronged to his
presence. At Cairo Delmedigo celebrated a complete
triumph with his mathematical knowledge,
when an old Mahometan teacher of mathematics, Ali
Ibn-Rahmadan, challenged him, a youth, to a public
combat, in which Ali was beaten. The victorious
combatant was magnanimous enough to show honor
to Ali before the world. Instead of betaking himself
to Palestine as he had intended, Delmedigo
traveled to Constantinople; here also he attached
himself to the circle of the Karaites, and at last
passed through Wallachia and Moldavia to Poland.
There, mathematics procuring him no bread, he
practiced medicine, of which, however, he had learnt
more from books than by the bedside of patients.
In Poland he passed for a great physician, and was
taken into the service of Prince Radziwill, in Wilna
(about 1619&ndash;1620). Here, through the excessive
attention given to the Talmud, general culture was
forsaken, but youths and men eager for learning,
especially Karaites, thronged to Delmedigo to slake
their thirst for knowledge. A half-crazed Karaite,
Serach ben Nathan of Trok, who had an inclination
to Rabbinical Judaism, in order to show his extensive
knowledge, with mock humility laid before him
a number of important questions, which Delmedigo
was to answer offhand, and sent him a sable fur for
the Polish winter.</p>

<p>Delmedigo found it to his advantage, in order to
give himself the appearance of a distinguished character
in Poland, to shroud himself in silence and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_77" id="Page_77">77</a></span>
seclusion. He at first answered Serach's questions
not personally, but through one of his companions,
an assistant and follower, Moses Metz. This man
described his teacher as a choice intellect, a demi-god,
who carried in his brain all human and divine
knowledge. He sketched his appearance and
character, his occupation and behavior, regulated,
as he said, by higher wisdom, gave information
about his descent from a learned and distinguished
family on his father's and his mother's side, and, as
his teacher's mouth-piece, imposed upon the credulous
Karaite by saying that he had composed works
on all branches of knowledge, at which the world
would be astonished, if they came to light. Metz
also communicated to Serach some of his teacher's
theories in mathematics, religion, and philosophy,
and thus still more confused Serach's mind. In his
communications on Judaism, which Delmedigo either
made himself or through Moses Metz, he was very
cautious; here and there, it is true, he allowed a
suggestion of unbelief to glimmer through, but
quickly covered it over with a haze of orthodoxy.
Only where he could do so without danger Delmedigo
expressed his real opinion.</p>

<p>When he at last sent the Karaite an answer to a
letter with his own hand (about 1621), he did not
conceal his true views, but declared his preference
for Karaism and its ancient teachers, loaded them
undeservedly with praise, exalted science, and ridiculed
the delusions of the Kabbala and its adherents.
In the same letter to Serach, Delmedigo indulged
in scoffs against the Talmud, and thought the Karaites
fortunate that they were able to dispense with
it. He had nothing to fear when he unburdened
his heart before his Karaite admirer.</p>

<p>Delmedigo does not seem, on the whole, to have
been at ease in Poland. He could not carouse with
the nobles whom he attended professionally for fear
of the Jews, and it was not possible to earn money<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_78" id="Page_78">78</a></span>
in so poor a country. So he betook himself by way
of Dantzic to Hamburg, where a Portuguese community
had been lately permitted to settle. His
knowledge of medicine seems to have met with little
esteem in the city on the Elbe. What was his skill
in comparison with that of the De Castros, father
and son? He was compelled, in order to subsist,
to undertake a certain amount of rabbinical duty, if
only as preacher. For the sake of bread he had
to play the hypocrite, and speak in favor of Rabbinical
Judaism. Nay, in order to dissipate the rumor
from Poland, which represented him as a heretic, he
was not ashamed to praise the Kabbala, which he
had shortly before condemned, as the highest wisdom,
before which philosophy and all sciences must
be dumb. For this purpose he prepared his defense
of the secret doctrine, in refutation of the crushing
arguments against it by one of his ancestors, Elias
Del Medigo. His work was of the kind to throw
dust in the eyes of the ignorant multitude; it displayed
a smattering of learning on all sorts of subjects,
but no trace of logic. He was too clever to
maintain the sheepish style of dull, stupid credulity,
and could not refrain from satire. He defended the
genuineness of the Zohar as an ancient work by
Simon bar Yocha√Ø, or at least by his school. He
argued that one must not be shocked by its many
incongruities and absurdities; the Talmud also contains
not a few, and is yet a sacred book. To save
his reputation with the more intelligent, Delmedigo
intimated that he had defended the Kabbala only
from necessity. We must not, he says, superficially
judge the character of an author by his words. He,
for instance, was writing this defense of the Kabbala
at the desire of a patron of high position, who was
enamored of it. Should this friend come to be of
another mind, and require an attack upon the Kabbala,
he would not refuse him. In conclusion, he
observes that philosophical students would no doubt<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_79" id="Page_79">79</a></span>
ridicule him for having turned his back on wisdom,
and betaken himself to folly; but he would rather
be called a fool all his life than for a single hour
transgress against piety.</p>

<p>This work, commenced in Hamburg, Delmedigo
could not finish there. A pestilence broke out, and
drove him, physician though he was, to Gl√ºckstadt.
In this small community, where, as he said, there
was neither town (Stadt) nor luck (Gl√ºck), he could
find no means of subsistence, and he traveled on to
Amsterdam about 1629. He could not attempt to
practice medicine in a city where physicians lived
of even higher eminence than at Hamburg, and so
was obliged a second time to apply himself to the
functions of rabbi. To show his importance, he
printed his scientific replies to the questions of his
Polish admirers, with the fulsome eulogies, clouds of
incense, and foolish homage which the young Karaite
Serach had offered him. It is a work of truly
Polish disorder, in which mathematical theorems and
scientific problems are discussed by the side of philosophical
and theological questions, in a confused
way. Delmedigo took care not to print his attacks
upon the Kabbala and the Talmud, and his preference
for the Karaites&mdash;in short, all that he had
written to please the rich Serach. Instead of publishing
an encyclop√¶dic work which he boastfully
said he had composed in his earliest youth, and
which embraced all sciences and solved all questions,
he produced a mere medley.</p>

<p>The Amsterdam community was then full of
suspicion against philosophy and culture owing to
the reckless behavior of Da Costa, and therefore
Delmedigo thought it advisable to ward off every
suspicion of unbelief, and get a reputation for strictest
orthodoxy. This transparent hypocrisy did not
answer well. He was, it is true, appointed preacher,
and partially rabbi, in or near Amsterdam, but he
could remain in Holland only a few years. Poor<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_80" id="Page_80">80</a></span>
and unstable as he was, he went with his wife to
Frankfort-on-the-Main about 1630 to seek means
of subsistence. But here, in a German community,
where Rabbinical learning was diffused, he could
not obtain a rabbinical office; but he could turn his
medical knowledge, scanty as it was, to account.
As he felt no vocation for the office of rabbi, nor for
medical practice, it was a matter of indifference if
he changed the preacher's gown for the doctor's
mantle. He was engaged, under irksome conditions,
as communal doctor (February 14, 1631).
How long he remained at Frankfort is not known;
his position cannot have been favorable, for he removed
to Prague (about 1648&ndash;1650), and in this
most neglected community he settled. Later (1652)
he was at Worms, probably only temporarily, and
ended his life, which had promised so much, and
realized so little, at Prague. Nor did he publish
any part of his great work, which he had announced
with so much pomposity.</p>

<p>In a measure Simone (Simcha) Luzzatto (born
about 1590, died 1663) may be reckoned among the
sceptics of this time. He was, at the same time as
Leo Modena, rabbi in Venice. Luzzatto was not
an eminent personage; but he had more solidity
than his colleague Modena, or than Delmedigo.
By the latter, who knew him personally, he was
praised as a distinguished mathematician. He was
also well read in ancient and modern literature.
His uprightness and love of truth, which he never
belied, distinguished him more than his knowledge
and learning. A parable which Luzzatto wrote in
Italian in his youth shows his views, as also his
maturity of thought, and that he had reflected early
on the relation of faith to science. He puts his
thoughts into the mouth of Socrates, the father of
Greek wisdom. At Delphi an academy had been
formed to rectify the errors of human knowledge.
Reason immediately presented a petition from the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_81" id="Page_81">81</a></span>
dungeon, where she had been so long kept by orthodox
authority, to be set at liberty. Although the
chief representatives of knowledge, Pythagoras and
Aristotle, spoke against this request, and uttered a
warning against her liberation, because, when free,
she would produce and spread abroad most frightful
errors, yet the academy set her at liberty; for by
that means alone could knowledge be promoted.
But the newly liberated minds caused great mischief;
and the academicians were at a loss what to
do. Then Socrates rose, and in a long speech
explained that reason and authority, if allowed to
reign alone, would produce only errors and mischief;
but if mutually limited, reason by revelation, and
revelation by reason, they mingle in the right proportion,
and produce beautiful harmony, whereby
man may attain his goal here below and hereafter.
This thought, that reason and faith must regulate
and keep watch over each other, which, in Maimuni's
time had passed into a commonplace, was at this
period, under the rule of Lurya's Kabbala, considered
in Jewish circles a bold innovation.</p>

<p>Simone Luzzatto did not suffer himself to be ensnared
by Kabbalistic delusions; he did not cast
reason behind him; he was a believer, but withal
sober-minded. He did not share the delusion of
Manasseh ben Israel and others that the lost tribes
of Israel were existing in some part of the world
enjoying independence as a military power. With
sober Jewish inquirers of former times, he assumed
that Daniel's revelation does not point to a future
Messiah, but only reflects historical events. He
composed a work on the manners and beliefs of the
Jews, which he proposed to exhibit "faithfully to
truth, without zeal and passion." It was probably
designed to form a counterpart to Leo Modena's
representation, which cast a shadow on Judaism.</p>

<p>Luzzatto's defense of Judaism and the Jews,
under the title "A Treatise on the Position of the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_82" id="Page_82">82</a></span>
Hebrews," is masterly. It speaks eloquently for
his practical, sober sense, for his love of truth, his
attachment to Judaism, and his solid knowledge.
He did not wish to dedicate it to any individual
patron out of flattery, but to the friends of truth in
general. He conjured these friends not to esteem
the remnant of the ancient Hebrew nation, even if
disfigured by sufferings, and saddened by long oppression,
more lightly than a mutilated work of art
by Phidias or Lysippus, since all men were agreed
that this nation was once animated and led by the
greatest of Masters. It is astonishing what thorough
knowledge the rabbi had of the commerce of that
time, and the influence upon it of the political position
of European and neighboring Asiatic states.
The object of his defense was primarily to disarm
the ill-will of certain Venetian patricians against the
Jews in that strictly governed state. The common
people had little antipathy to the Jews; they lived
to some extent on them. But among those who
had a share in the government there were fanatical
religious zealots and envious opponents, who advocated
further restrictions, or even banishment. It
did not suit them that the Venetian Jews, who, shut
up in the Ghetto, possessed neither land nor the
right to carry on a handicraft, competed with them
in finance and trade. The commercial city of
Venice, far surpassed by the new naval powers,
Holland and England, which had gradually obtained
control of the trade with the Levant, saw many of
its great houses of business in splendid misery, while
new Jewish capitalists stepped into their place, and
seized the Levantine business. With artful turns and
delicate hints, Luzzatto gave the politicians of Venice
to understand that exhaustion was hastening the
downfall of the republic. The prosperous cared
only to keep what they had acquired and for enjoyment,
and former Venetian commerce seemed to be
falling into the hands of foreigners. Hence the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_83" id="Page_83">83</a></span>
Jews had become a blessing to the state. It was
more advisable to leave its extensive trade, especially
that of the East, to native Jews, and to protect
them, than to see it diverted to neighboring towns,
or to strangers, who formed a state within the state,
were not always obedient to the laws, and gradually
carried the ready money out of the country. Luzzatto
calculated from statistics that the Jews contributed
more than 250,000 ducats to the republic every
year, that they gave bread to 4,000 workpeople,
supplied home manufactures at a cheap rate, and
obtained goods from distant countries. It was
reserved for a rabbi to bring this political-economical
consideration, of vital importance for the island
republic, to the notice of wise councilors. Luzzatto
also called attention to the important advantage
which the capital of the Jews had recently been,
when, during the pestilence and the dissolution of
political government, the Jews had spontaneously
offered money to the state to prevent embarrassment.</p>

<p>Luzzatto also defended the Jews against attacks
on the religious side, but on this point his exposition
is not original. If he brought out the bright traits
of his Jewish contemporaries, he by no means
passed over their dark ones in silence, and that
redounds to his credit. Luzzatto depicted them
in the following manner. However different may
be the manner of Venetian Jews from their brethren
in Constantinople, Damascus, Germany, or Poland,
they all have something in <span class="locked">common:&mdash;</span></p>

<blockquote>

<p>"It is a nation of timid and unmanly disposition, at present incapable
of political government, occupied only with its separate interests,
and caring little about the public welfare. The economy of the Jews
borders on avarice; they are admirers of antiquity, and have no eye
for the present course of things. Many are uneducated, without
taste for learning or the knowledge of languages, and, in following
the laws of their religion, they exaggerate to the most painful degree.
But they have also noteworthy peculiarities&mdash;firmness and endurance
in their religion, uniformity of doctrinal teaching in the long course
of more than fifteen centuries since the dispersion; wonderful steadfastness,
which leads them, if not to go into dangers, yet to endure<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_84" id="Page_84">84</a></span>
the severest suffering. They possess knowledge of Holy Scripture
and its exposition, gentleness and hospitality to the members of their
race&mdash;the Persian Jew in some degree suffers the wrongs of the Italian&mdash;strict
abstinence from carnal offenses, extraordinary carefulness
to keep the family unspotted, and skill in managing difficult matters.
They are submissive and yielding to everyone, only not to their brethren
in religion. The failings of the Jews have rather the character
of cowardice and meanness than of cruelty and atrocity."</p></blockquote>

<p>What Luzzatto's position was with regard to the
Talmud he did not distinctly state, but only explained
generally that there are three or four classes
of Jews: Talmudists or Rabbanites, who hold the
oral law of equal authority with the Bible; secondly,
a philosophical and cultured class; and, lastly, Kabbalists,
and Karaites. Yet he intimated that he
held the Talmudical tradition to be true; whilst he
considered the Kabbala as not of Jewish, but of Platonic,
Pythagorean, and Gnostic origin. One of his
disciples relates of him that he ridiculed the Kabbalists,
and thought their theory had no claim to the
title of tradition; it was wanting in the Holy Spirit.</p>

<p>These four thinkers, more or less dissatisfied
with the Judaism of the day, who were furnished
with so much intellect, knowledge, and eloquence,
yet exerted very little influence over their Jewish
contemporaries, and thus did not break through the
prevailing obscurity in the smallest degree. Luzzatto
wrote for only a limited class of readers, and
did not inflict, or wish to inflict, heavy blows on
Judaism. Uriel da Costa missed his mark on account
of his violent, impatient disposition; Leo
Modena was himself too wavering, driven hither
and thither by the wind of conflicting opinions, to
acquire serious convictions and do battle for them.
His attacks on the weak side of Judaism, as has
been stated, were made in private. Joseph Delmedigo
did more harm than good through his insincerity
and hypocrisy. Lacking character, he sank
so low as to speak in favor of the confused doctrines
of the Kabbala, and by the weight of his knowledge
confirmed and increased the delusion of the multitude.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_85" id="Page_85">85</a></span>
But from two other quarters, by two quite
opposite characters, weighty blows against Judaism
were delivered, threatening completely to shatter it.
Reason incorporated, as it were, in one Jew, and
unreason incarnate in another, joined hands to treat
Judaism as abolished and dissolved, and, so to
speak, to dethrone the God of Israel.</p>

<p>Whilst Manasseh ben Israel was zealously laboring
to complete the fabric of Judaism by hastening on
the Messianic era, one of his disciples was applying
an intellectual lever to destroy this edifice to its
foundation and convert it into a shapeless dust
heap. He was earnest about what was only amusement
for Leo Modena. The Jewish race once
more brought a deep thinker into the world, one
who was radically to heal the human mind of its
rooted perversities and errors, and to prescribe a
new direction for it, that it might better comprehend
the connection between heaven and earth, between
mind and matter. Like his ancestor Abraham, this
Jewish thinker desired to break to pieces all idols
and vain images, before which men had hitherto
bowed down through fear, custom, and indolence,
and to reveal to them a new God, not enthroned in
heaven's height beyond their reach, but living and
moving within them, whose temple they themselves
should be. His influence was like that of the storm,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_87" id="Page_87">87</a></span>
deafening and crushing down, but also purifying and
refreshing.</p>

<p>The lightning flashes of this great philosophical
genius did greatest injury to Judaism which was
nearest to him. In the degradation of the religion
of his day and its professors, even his searching
gaze could not recognize the fair form concealed
beneath a loathsome exterior.</p>

<p>This great thinker, the most famous philosopher
of his time, who brought about a new redemption,
was Baruch Spinoza (really Espinosa, born in Spain
1632, died 1677). He belonged to a family eminent
for neither intellect nor wealth. No sign at his birth
portended that he would reign for more than two
centuries a king in the realm of thought. With
many other boys, he attended the Jewish school,
consisting of seven classes, recently established in
Amsterdam, whither his parents had migrated.
With his extraordinary talents he surely kept pace
with the requirements of the school, if he did not
exceed them. In his thirteenth or fourteenth year
he was probably introduced by Manasseh ben Israel
to the study of the Talmud, and initiated into
Hebrew grammar, rhetoric, and poetry. He received
final instruction in Rabbinical lore from Saul
Morteira, the greatest Talmudist of his time in Amsterdam.
Together with Spinoza Morteira taught
others who later had more or less influence on Jewish
history, but were of quite another stamp.</p>

<p>Moses Zacut (1630&ndash;1697), a descendant of the
famous family of that name, was held to be Morteira's
first disciple. From his youth upwards, with
his predilection for mysticism and poetry, he formed
a direct contrast to Spinoza. He loved what was
inexact and obscure, Spinoza the clear and definite.
Two incidents may serve to portray Moses Zacut.
He was asked when young what he thought of the
fabulous narratives of Rabba Bar-Bar-Chana in the
Talmud, which are like those of M√ºnchhausen, and he<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_88" id="Page_88">88</a></span>
replied that he regarded them as historical. When
young he learned Latin like most Portuguese youths
in Amsterdam. Later, he so regretted having learned
that language, that he fasted forty days in order to
forget it, because, as he thought, this tongue of the
devil was not compatible with Kabbalistic truth.
Another fellow-disciple of Spinoza was Isaac Naar
(Nahar), likewise a mystic, and of a spiteful and not
over-scrupulous nature.</p>

<p>Thirst for knowledge stimulated Spinoza to venture
beyond the limited circle of studies pursued in
Morteira's lecture-room. He plunged into the
writings of older Jewish thinkers, three of whom
alike attracted and repelled him: Ibn-Ezra with his
free-thinking and his reticence, Moses Maimuni with
his artificial system, aiming at the reconciliation of
faith and science, of Judaism and philosophy, and
Chasda√Ø Crescas with his hostility to traditional philosophy.
Spinoza was also at home in the Kabbala,
the main doctrines of which had been rendered accessible
through Abraham de Herrera and Isaac
Aboab. These various elements heaved and fermented
in his mind, which strove for insight, and
excited in his breast tormenting doubts, to which
Ibn-Ezra's covert unbelief mainly contributed. A
youth of fifteen, Spinoza is said to have expressed
his doubts in the form of questions to his master
Morteira, which may have not a little perplexed a
rabbi accustomed to beaten tracks. To these elements
of scepticism, conveyed to him from Jewish
literature, others were added from without. Spinoza
learned Latin, in itself nothing remarkable, since, as
has been remarked, nearly all the Jewish youths of
Amsterdam, as well as Christians of the educated
classes of Holland, regarded that language as a
means of culture. But he was not contented with
superficial knowledge; he desired to drink deep of
classical literature. He sought the instruction of an
eminent philologist of his time, Dr. Franz van den<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_89" id="Page_89">89</a></span>
Enden, who lectured in Amsterdam to noble youths,
native and foreign. Here he learned, in contact
with educated Christian youths, to adopt a different
point of view from that which obtained in Morteira's
lecture-room and in Jewish circles. Van den Enden
also strongly influenced his mind. Though not an
atheist, he was a man of sceptical and satirical vein,
who turned religious customs and prejudices to ridicule,
and exposed their weaknesses. But what
with him was the object of humor and wit, excited
Spinoza's susceptible and analytical mind to deep
reflection and meditation. The natural sciences,
mathematics, and physics, which he pursued with
devotion, and the new-born, imposing philosophy of
Descartes (Cartesius), for which his mind had
special affinity, extended his circle of vision and
enlightened his judgment. The more he imbibed
ideas from various sources, assimilating them with
those innate in him, and the more his logical understanding
developed, the more did he become alienated
from Judaism, in its Rabbinical and Kabbalistic
trappings, and love of Van den Enden's learned
daughter was not needed to make him a pervert
from Jewish belief.</p>

<p>Independent, judicial reason, which disregards
what is traditional or hallowed by time, and follows
its own laws, was his mistress. To her he dedicated
pure, undivided worship, and she led him to break
with inherited views. All that cannot be justified
before the inexorable tribunal of clear human vision,
passed with him for superstition and clouded
thought, if not actual frenzy. His ardent desire for
truth, pure truth and certainty, led him to a complete
breach with the religion endeared to him from
childhood; he not only rejected Talmudical Judaism,
but also regarded the Bible as the work of man.
The apparent contradictions in the books of Holy
Scripture appear to have first raised his doubts as
to their inspiration. It must have cost him a hard<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_90" id="Page_90">90</a></span>
struggle to give up the customs and opinions endeared
to him through manifold ties, and to become,
to a certain extent, a new man. For Spinoza was
quite as much a moral character as a deep thinker.
To hold anything as false in theory, and yet from
fear, custom, or advantage to adopt it in practice
was impossible for him. He was differently constituted
to his revered master Descartes, who kept
away from the church the torch of truth which he
had kindled, made a gap between theory and practice
to avoid offending that church, and, for example,
vowed a pilgrimage to our Lady of Loretto for the
success of his system and its destructive tendency.
According to Spinoza's idea every action ought to
be a true reflection of reason. When he could no
longer find truth in Judaism, he could not bring himself
to follow its ritual precepts. He ceased to attend
the synagogue, cared no longer for the Sabbath
and the festivals, and broke the laws concerning
diet. He did not confine himself to the renunciation
of Judaism, but imparted his convictions to young
men who sought his instruction.</p>

<p>The representatives of the community of Amsterdam
were the more concerned at the daily increasing
report of Spinoza's estrangement from, and
hostility to Judaism, as they had in a measure looked
upon the gifted youth as their exponent, and as a
firm support to the jeopardized religion of their
fathers. Now it was to be feared that he would
abandon it, go over to Christianity, and devote his
intellectual gifts to doing battle against his mother-faith.
Could the representatives of that faith, the
college of rabbis and the secular heads of the
community, behold with indifference this systematic
neglect of Judaism in their midst? Fugitives were
ever coming from Spain and Portugal, who forfeited
their high position, and staked life and property, to
remain true to Judaism. Others with unbending
attachment to the faith of their fathers, let themselves<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_91" id="Page_91">91</a></span>
be dragged to the dark prisons of the Inquisition,
or with cheerful courage mounted the
funeral pile. A contemporary writer, an eye-witness,
reports:</p>

<blockquote>

<p>"In Spain and Portugal there are monasteries and convents full of
Jews. Not a few conceal Judaism in their heart and feign Christianity
on account of worldly goods. Some of these feel the stings of
conscience and escape, if they are able. In this city (Amsterdam)
and in several other places, we have monks, Augustinians, Franciscans,
Jesuits, Dominicans, who have rejected idolatry. There are
bishops in Spain and grave monks, whose parents, brothers, or sisters,
dwell here (in Amsterdam) and in other cities in order to be able to
profess Judaism."</p></blockquote>

<p>At the very time when Spinoza became estranged
from Judaism, the smoke and flames of the funeral
piles of Jewish martyrs rose in several cities of Spain
and Portugal, in Cuenca, Granada, Santiago de
Compostela, Cordova, and Lisbon.</p>

<p>In the last-named city a distinguished Marrano,
Manuel Fernando de Villa-Real, statesman, political
writer, and poet, who conducted the consular
affairs of the Portuguese court at Paris, returned to
Lisbon on business, was seized by the Inquisition,
gagged, and led to execution (December 1, 1652).
In Cuenca on one day (June 29, 1654) fifty-seven
Christian proselytes to Judaism were dragged to the
auto-da-f√©. Most of them only received corporal
chastisement with loss of property, but ten
were burned to death. Amongst them was a distinguished
man, the court-saddler Balthasar Lopez,
from Valladolid, who had amassed a fortune of
100,000 ducats. He had migrated to Bayonne,
where a small community of former Marranos was
tolerated, and had returned to Spain only to persuade
a nephew to come back to Judaism. He was
seized by the Inquisition, tortured, and condemned
to death by the halter and the stake. On his way
to the scaffold, Balthasar Lopez ridiculed the Inquisition
and Christianity. He exclaimed to the
executioner about to bind him, "I do not believe in
your Christ, even if you bind me," and threw the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_92" id="Page_92">92</a></span>
cross which had been forced upon him to the ground.
Five months later twelve Marranos were burnt in
Granada. Again, some months later (March, 1655),
a promising youth of twenty, Marcos da Almeyda
Bernal, whose Jewish name was Isaac, died at the
stake; and two months afterwards (May 3d) Abraham
Nu√±es Bernal was burnt at Cordova.</p>

<p>Whoever in the community of Amsterdam could
compose verses in Spanish, Portuguese, or Latin,
sang or bewailed the martyrdom of the two Bernals.
Was Spinoza's view correct that all these martyrs,
and the thousands of Jewish victims still hounded by
the Inquisition, pursued a delusion? Could the representatives
of Judaism allow unreproved, in their
immediate neighborhood, the promulgation of the
idea that Judaism is merely an antiquated error?</p>

<p>The college of rabbis, in which sat the two chief
Chachams, Saul Morteira and Isaac Aboab&mdash;Manasseh
ben Israel was then living in London&mdash;had
ascertained the fact of Spinoza's change of opinion,
and had collected evidence. It was not easy to
accuse him of apostasy, as he did not proclaim his
thoughts aloud in the market-place, as Uriel da
Costa had announced his breach with Judaism.
Besides, he led a quiet, self-contained life, and associated
little with men. His avoidance of the synagogue,
the first thing probably to attract notice,
could not form the subject of a Rabbinical accusation.
It is possible that, as is related, two of his fellow-students
(one, perhaps, the sly Isaac Naar) thrust
themselves upon him, drew him out, and accused
him of unbelief, and contempt for Judaism. Spinoza
was summoned, tried, and admonished to return to
his former course of life. The court of rabbis did
not at first proceed with severity against him, for he
was a favorite of his teacher, and beloved in the
community on account of his modest bearing and
moral behavior. By virtue of the firmness of his
character Spinoza probably made no sort of concession,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_93" id="Page_93">93</a></span>
but insisted upon freedom of thought and conduct.
Without doubt he was, in consequence, laid
under the lesser excommunication, that is, close intercourse
with him was forbidden for thirty days. This
probably caused less pain to Spinoza, who, self-centred,
found sufficient resource in his rich world
of thought, than to the superficial Da Costa. Also,
he was not without Christian friends, and he, therefore,
made no alteration in his manner of life. This
firmness was naturally construed as obstinacy
and defiance. But the rabbinate, as well as the
secular authorities of the community did not wish
to exert the rigor of the Rabbinical law against him,
in order not to drive him to an extreme measure,
i. e., into the arms of the Church. What harm might
not the conversion to Christianity of so remarkable
a youth entail in a newly-founded community, consisting
of Jews with Christian reminiscences! What
impression would it make on the Marranos in Spain
and Portugal? Perhaps the scandal caused by Da
Costa's excommunication, still fresh in men's memories,
may have rendered a repetition impracticable.
The rabbis, therefore, privately offered Spinoza,
through his friends, a yearly pension of a thousand
gulden on condition that he take no hostile step
against Judaism, and show himself from time to time
in the synagogue. But Spinoza, though young, was
of so determined a character, that money could not
entice him to abandon his convictions or to act the
hypocrite. He insisted that he would not give up
freedom of inquiry and thought. He continued to
impart to Jewish youths doctrines undermining
Judaism. So the tension between him and the representatives
of Judaism became daily greater; both
sides were right, or imagined they were. A fanatic
in Amsterdam thought that he could put an end to
this breach by a dagger-stroke aimed at the dangerous
apostate. He waylaid Spinoza at the exit
from the theatre, and struck at the philosopher with<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_94" id="Page_94">94</a></span>
his murderous weapon. But the latter observed the
hostile movement in time, and avoided the blow, so
that only his coat was damaged. Spinoza left
Amsterdam to avoid the danger of assassination,
and betook himself to the house of a friend, likewise
persecuted by the dominant Calvinistic Church, an
adherent of the sect of the Rhynsburgians, or Collectants,
who dwelt in a village between Amsterdam
and Ouderkerk. Reconciliation between Spinoza
and the synagogue was no longer to be thought of.
The rabbis and the secular authorities of the community
pronounced the greater excommunication
upon him, proclaiming it in the Portuguese language
on a Thursday, Ab 6th (July 24th), 1656, shortly
before the fast in memory of the destruction of
Jerusalem. The sentence was pronounced solemnly
in the synagogue from the pulpit before the open
Ark. The sentence was as follows:</p>

<blockquote>

<p>"The council has long had notice of the evil opinions and actions
of Baruch d'Espinosa, and these are daily increasing in spite of efforts
to reclaim him. In particular, he teaches and proclaims dreadful
heresy, of which credible witnesses are present, who have made their
depositions in presence of the accused."</p></blockquote>

<p>All this, they continued, had been proved in the
presence of the elders, and the council had resolved
to place him under the ban, and excommunicate him.</p>

<p>The usual curses were pronounced upon him in
presence of scrolls of the Law, and finally the council
forbade any one to have intercourse with him,
verbally or by writing, to do him any service, to
abide under the same roof with him, or to come
within the space of four cubits' distance from him, or
to read his writings. Contrary to wont, the ban
against Spinoza was stringently enforced, to keep
young people from his heresies.</p>

<p>Spinoza was away from Amsterdam, when the
ban was hurled against him. He is said to have received
the news with indifference, and to have
remarked that he was now compelled to do what he<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_95" id="Page_95">95</a></span>
would otherwise have done without compulsion.
His philosophic nature, which loved solitude, could
easily dispense with intercourse with relatives and
former friends. Yet the matter did not end for him
there. The representative body of the Portuguese
community appealed to the municipal authorities to
effect his perpetual banishment from Amsterdam.
The magistrates referred the question, really a theological
one, to the clergy, and the latter are said
to have proposed his withdrawal from Amsterdam
for some months. Most probably this procedure
prompted him to elaborate a justificatory pamphlet
to show the civil authorities that he was no violator
or transgressor of the laws of the state, but that he
had exercised his just rights, when he reflected on
the religion of his forefathers and religion generally,
and thought out new views. The chain of reasoning
suggested to Spinoza in the preparation of his defense
caused him doubtless to give wider extension
and bearing to this question. It gave him the opportunity
to treat of freedom of thought and inquiry
generally, and so to lay the foundation of the first
of his suggestive writings, which have conferred
upon him literary immortality. In the village to
which he had withdrawn, 1656&ndash;60, and later in
Rhynsburg, where he also spent several years,
1660&ndash;64, Spinoza occupied himself (while polishing
lenses, which handicraft he had learned to secure his
moderate subsistence) with the Cartesian philosophy
and the elaboration of the work entitled "The Theologico-Political
Treatise." His prime object was to
spread the conviction that freedom of thought can
be permitted without prejudice to religion and the
peace of the state; furthermore, that it must be permitted,
for if it were forbidden, religion and peace
could not exist in the state.</p>

<p>The apology for freedom of thought had been
rendered harder rather than easier for Spinoza, by
the subsidiary ideas with which he crossed the main<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_96" id="Page_96">96</a></span>
lines of his system. He could not philosophically
find the source of law, and transferred its origin to
might. Neither God, nor man's conscience, according
to Spinoza, is the fountain of the eternal law
which rules and civilizes mankind; it springs from
the whole lower natural world. He made men to a
certain extent "like the fishes of the sea, like creeping
things, which have no master." Large fish have
the right, not only to drink water, but also to devour
smaller fish, because they have the power to do so;
the sphere of right of the individual man extends as
far as his sphere of might. This natural right does
not recognize the difference between good and evil,
virtue and vice, submission and force. But because
such unlimited assertion on the part of each must
lead to a perpetual state of war of all against all,
men have tacitly, from fear, or hope, or reason, given
up their unlimited privileges to a collective body, the
state. Out of two evils&mdash;on the one hand, the full
possession of their sphere of right and might, tending
to mutual destruction, and its alienation, on the
other&mdash;men have chosen the latter as the lesser
evil. The state, whether represented by a supreme
authority elected for the purpose, such as the Dutch
States General, or by a despot, is the full possessor
of the rights of all, because of the power of all.
Every one is bound by his own interest to unconditional
obedience, even if he should be commanded
to deprive others of life; resistance is not only punishable,
but contrary to reason. This supreme
power is not controlled by any law. Whether exercised
by an individual, as in a monarchy, or by several,
as in a republic, it is justified in doing everything,
and can do no wrong. But the state has
supreme right not merely over actions of a civil nature,
but also over spiritual and religious views; it
could not exist, if everyone were at liberty to attack
it under the pretext of religion. The government
alone has the right to control religious affairs, and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_97" id="Page_97">97</a></span>
to define belief, unbelief, orthodoxy, and heresy.
What a tyrannical conclusion! As this theory of
Spinoza fails to recognize moral law, so it ignores
steadfast fidelity. As soon as the government
grows weak, it no longer has claim to obedience;
everyone may renounce and resist it, to submit himself
to the incoming power. According to this
theory of civil and religious despotism, no one may
have an opinion about the laws of the state, otherwise
he is a rebel. Spinoza's theory almost does
away with freedom, even of thought and opinion.
Whoever speaks against a state ordinance in a
fault-finding spirit, or to throw odium upon the government,
or seeks to repeal a law against its express
wish, should be regarded as a disturber of the public
peace. Only through a sophistical quibble was
Spinoza able to save freedom of thought and free
expression of opinion. Every man has this right by
nature, the only one which he has not transferred
to the state, because it is essentially inalienable. It
must be conceded to everyone to think and judge
in opposition to the opinion of the government, even
to speak and teach, provided this be done with
reason and reflection, without fraud, anger, or
malice, and without the intention of causing a revolution.</p>

<p>On this weak basis, supported by a few other secondary
considerations, Spinoza justified his conflict
with Judaism and his philosophical attacks upon the
sacred writings recognized by the Dutch States.
He thought that he had succeeded in justifying himself
before the magistrates sufficiently by his defense
of freedom of thought. In the formulation of this
apology it was apparent that he was not indifferent
to the treatment which he had experienced from the
college of rabbis. Spinoza was so filled with displeasure,
if not with hatred, of Jews and Judaism,
that his otherwise clear judgment was biased. He,
like Da Costa, called the rabbis nothing but Pharisees,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_98" id="Page_98">98</a></span>
and imputed to them ambitious and degraded
motives, while they wished only to secure their
treasured beliefs against attacks. Prouder even
than his contemporaries, the French and English
philosophers, of freedom of thought, for centuries
repressed by the church, and now soaring aloft the
more powerfully, Spinoza summoned theology, in
particular, ancient Judaism before the throne of
reason, examined its dogmas and archives, and pronounced
sentence of condemnation upon his mother-faith.
He had erected a tower of thought in his
brain from which, as it were, he wished to storm
heaven. Spinoza's philosophy is like a fine net, laid
before our eyes, mesh by mesh, by which the human
understanding is unexpectedly ensnared, so that
half voluntarily, half compulsorily, it surrenders.
Spinoza recognized, as no thinker before, those
universal laws, immutable as iron, which are apparent
in the development of the most insignificant
grain of seed no less than in the revolution of the
heavenly bodies, in the precision of mathematical
thought as in the apparent irregularity of human
passions. Whilst these laws work with constant
uniformity, and produce the same causes and the
same phenomena in endless succession, the instruments
of law are perishable things, creatures of a
day, which rise, and vanish to give place to others:
here eternity, there temporality; on the one side
necessity, on the other chance; here reality, there
delusive appearances. These and other enigmas
Spinoza sought to solve with the penetration that
betrays the son of the Talmud, and with logical consecutiveness
and masterly arrangement, for which
Aristotle might have envied him.</p>

<p>The whole universe, all individual things, and
their active powers are, according to Spinoza, not
merely from God, but of God; they constitute the
infinite succession of forms in which God reveals
Himself, through which He eternally works according<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_99" id="Page_99">99</a></span>
to His eternal nature&mdash;the soul, as it were, of
thinking bodies, the body of the soul extended in
space. God is the indwelling, not the external
efficient cause of all things; all is in God and moves
in God. God as creator and generator of all things
is generative or self-producing nature. The whole
of nature is animate, and ideas, as bodies, move in
eternity on lines running parallel to or intersecting
one another. Though the fullness of things which
have proceeded from God and which exist in Him
are not of an eternal, but of a perishable nature, yet
they are not limited or defined by chance, but by the
necessity of the divine nature, each in its own way
existing or acting within its smaller or larger sphere.
The eternal and constant nature of God works in
them through the eternal laws communicated to
them. Things could, therefore, not be constituted
otherwise than they are; for they are the manifestations,
entering into existence in an eternal stream,
of God in the intimate connection of thought and
extension.</p>

<p>What is man's place in this logical system? How
is he to act and work? Even he, with all his greatness
and littleness, his strength and weakness, his
heaven-aspiring mind, and his body subject to the
need of sustenance, is nothing more than a form of
existence (Modus) of God. Man after man, generation
after generation, springs up and perishes, flows
away like a drop in a perpetual stream, but his
nature, the laws by which he moves bodily and mentally
in the peculiar connection of mind and matter,
reflect the Divine Being. Especially the human
mind, or rather the various modes of thought, the
feelings and conceptions of all men, form the eternal
reason of God. But man is as little free as things,
as the stone which rolls down from the mountain;
he has to obey the causes which influence him from
within and without. Each of his actions is the product
of an infinite series of causes and effects, which<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_100" id="Page_100">100</a></span>
he can scarcely discern, much less control and
alter at will. The good man and the bad, the martyr
who sacrifices himself for a noble object, as well as
the execrable villain and the murderer, are all like
clay in the hands of God; they act, the one well, the
other ill, compelled by their inner nature. They all
act from rigid necessity. No man can reproach
God for having given him a weak nature or a
clouded intellect, as it would be irrational if a circle
should complain that God has not given it the nature
and properties of the sphere. It is not the lot of
every man to be strong-minded, and it lies as little
in his power to have a sound mind as a sound body.</p>

<p>On one side man is, to a certain extent, free, or
rather some men of special mental endowments can
free themselves a little from the pressure exercised
upon them. Man is a slave chiefly through his
passions. Love, hate, anger, thirst for glory, avarice,
make him the slave of the external world. These
passions spring from the perplexity of the soul, which
thinks it can control things, but wears itself out, so
to speak, against their obstinate resistance, and
suffers pain thereby. The better the soul succeeds
in comprehending the succession of causes
and effects and the necessity of phenomena in the
plan of the universe, the better able is it to change
pain into a sense of comfort. Through higher
insight, man, if he allows himself to be led by reason,
can acquire strength of soul, and feel increased love
to God, that is, to the eternal whole. On the one
hand, this secures nobility of mind to aid men and
to win them by mildness and benevolence; and
creates, on the other, satisfaction, joy, and happiness.
He who is gifted with highest knowledge lives in
God, and God in him. Knowledge is virtue, as
ignorance is, to a certain extent, vice. Whilst the
wise man, or strictly speaking, the philosopher,
thanks to his higher insight and his love of God,
enjoys tranquillity of soul, the man of clouded intellect,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_101" id="Page_101">101</a></span>
who abandons himself to the madness of his
passions, must dispense with this joyousness, and
often perishes in consequence. The highest virtue,
according to Spinoza's system, is self-renunciation
through knowledge, keeping in a state of passiveness,
coming as little as possible in contact with the
crushing machinery of forces&mdash;avoiding them if they
come near, or submitting to them if their wild career
overthrows the individual. But as he who is beset
by desires deserves no blame, so no praise is due
the wise man who practices self-renunciation; both
follow the law of their nature. Higher knowledge
and wisdom cannot be attained if the conditions
are wanting, namely, a mind susceptible of knowledge
and truth, which one can neither give himself,
nor throw off. Man has thus no final aim, any more
than the eternal substance.</p>

<p>Spinoza's moral doctrines&mdash;ethics in the narrower
sense&mdash;are just as unfruitful as his political theories.
In either case, he recognizes submission as the only
rational course.</p>

<p>With this conception of God and moral action, it
cannot surprise us that Judaism found no favor in
Spinoza's eyes. Judaism lays down directly opposite
principles&mdash;beckons man to a high, self-reliant
task, and proclaims aloud the progress of
mankind in simple service of God, holiness, and
victory over violence, the sword, and degrading war.
This progress has been furthered in many ways by
Judaism in the course of ages. Wanting, as Spinoza
was, in apprehension of historical events, more wonderful
than the phenomena of nature, and unable as
he therefore was to accord to Judaism special importance,
he misconceived it still further through his
bitterness against the Amsterdam college of rabbis,
who pardonably enough, had excommunicated him.
Spinoza transferred his bitterness against the community
to the whole Jewish race and to Judaism.
As has been already said, he called the rabbis<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_102" id="Page_102">102</a></span>
Pharisees in his "Theologico-Political Treatise" and
in letters to his friends, and gave the most invidious
meaning to this word. To Christianity, on the
contrary, Spinoza conceded great excellencies; he
regarded Judaism with displeasure, therefore, detected
deficiencies and absurdities everywhere, while
he cast a benevolent eye upon Christianity, and
overlooked its weaknesses. Spinoza, therefore, with
all the instinct for truth which characterized him,
formed a conception of Judaism which, in some
degree just, was, in many points, perverse and defective.
Clear as his mind was in metaphysical
inquiries, it was dark and confused on historical
ground. To depreciate Judaism, Spinoza declared
that the books of Holy Scripture contain scribes'
errors, interpolations, and disfigurements, and are
not, as a rule, the work of the authors to whom they
are ascribed&mdash;not even the Pentateuch, the original
source of Judaism. Ezra, perhaps, first collected
and arranged it after the Babylonian exile. The
genuine writings of Moses are no longer extant,
not even the Ten Commandments being in their
original form. Nevertheless, Spinoza accepted
every word in the Bible as a kind of revelation, and
designated all persons who figure in it as prophets.
He conceded, on the ground of Scripture, that the
revelation of the prophets was authenticated by
visible signs. Nevertheless, he very much underrated
this revelation. Moses, the prophets, and all
the higher personages of the Bible had only a confused
notion of God, nature, and living beings; they
were not philosophers, they did not avail themselves
of the natural light of reason. Jesus stood higher;
he taught not only a nation, but the whole of mankind
on rational grounds. The Apostles, too, were
to be set higher than the prophets, since they introduced
a natural method of instruction, and worked
not merely through signs, but also through rational
conviction. As though the main effort of the Apostles,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_103" id="Page_103">103</a></span>
to which their whole zeal was devoted, viz., to
reach belief in the miraculous resurrection of Jesus,
were consistent with reason! It was only Spinoza's
bitterness against Jews which caused him to depreciate
their spiritual property and overrate Christianity.
His sober intellect, penetrating to the
eternal connection of things and events, could not
accept miracles, but those of the New Testament
he judged mildly.</p>

<p>In spite of his condemnatory verdict on Judaism,
he was struck by two phenomena, which he did not
fully understand, and which, therefore, he judged only
superficially according to his system. These were
the moral greatness of the prophets, and the superiority
of the Israelite state, which in a measure depend
on each other. Without understanding the
political organization, in which natural and moral
laws, necessity and freedom work together, Spinoza
explains the origin of the Jewish state, that is, of
Judaism, in the following manner: When the Israelites,
after deliverance from slavery in Egypt, were
free from all political bondage, and restored to their
natural rights, they willingly chose God as their
Lord, and transferred their rights to Him alone by
formal contract and alliance. That there be no appearance
of fraud on the divine side, God permitted
them to recognize His marvelous power, by virtue
of which He had hitherto preserved, and promised
in future to preserve them, that is, He revealed
Himself to them in His glory on Sinai; thus God
became the King of Israel and the state a theocracy.
Religious opinions and truths, therefore, had
a legal character in this state, religion and civic right
coincided. Whoever revolted from religion forfeited
his rights as a citizen, and whoever died for religion
was a patriot. Pure democratic equality, the right
of all to entreat God and interpret the laws, prevailed
among the Israelites. But when, in the overpowering
bewilderment of the revelation from Sinai,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_104" id="Page_104">104</a></span>
they voluntarily asked Moses to receive the laws
from God and to interpret them, they renounced
their equality, and transferred their rights to Moses.
Moses from that time became God's representative.
Hence, he promulgated laws suited to the condition
of the people at that time, and introduced ceremonies
to remind them always of the Law and keep
them from willfulness, so that in accordance with a
definite precept they should plough, sow, eat, clothe
themselves, in a word, do everything according to
the precepts of the Law. Above all, he provided
that they might not act from childish or slavish fear,
but from reverence for God. He bound them by
benefits, and promised them earthly prosperity&mdash;all
through the power and by the command of God.
Moses was vested with spiritual and civil power, and
authorized to transmit both. He preferred to transfer
the civil power to his disciple Joshua in full, but
not as a heritage, and the spiritual power to his
brother Aaron as a heritage, but limited by the civil
ruler, and not accompanied by a grant of territory.
After the death of Moses the Jewish state was
neither a monarchy, nor an aristocracy, nor a
democracy; it remained a theocracy. The family
of the high-priest was God's interpreter, and the
civil power, after Joshua's death, fell to single tribes
or their chiefs.</p>

<p>This constitution offered many advantages. The
civil rulers could not turn the law to their own
advantage, nor oppress the people, for the Law was
the province of the sacerdotal order&mdash;the sons of
Aaron and the Levites. Besides, the people were
made acquainted with the Law through the prescribed
reading at the close of the Sabbatical year,
and would not have passed over with indifference
any willful transgression of the law of the state.
The army was composed of native militia, while
foreigners, that is, mercenaries, were excluded.
Thus the rulers were prevented from oppressing<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_105" id="Page_105">105</a></span>
the people or waging war arbitrarily. The tribes
were united by religion, and the oppression of
one tribe by its ruler would have been punished
by the rest. The princes were not placed at the
head through rank or privilege of blood, but through
capacity and merit. Finally, the institution of
prophets proved very wholesome. Since the constitution
was theocratical, every one of blameless
life was able through certain signs to represent himself
as a prophet like Moses, draw the oppressed
people to him in the name of God, and oppose the
tyranny of the rulers. This peculiar constitution
produced in the heart of the Israelites an especial
patriotism, which was at the same time a religion, so
that no one would betray it, leave God's kingdom,
or swear allegiance to a foreigner. This love,
coupled with hatred against other nations, and fostered
by daily worship of God, became second nature
to the Israelites. It strengthened them to endure
everything for their country with steadfastness and
courage. This constitution offered a further advantage,
because the land was equally divided, and no
one could be permanently deprived of his portion
through poverty, as restitution had to be made in the
year of jubilee.</p>

<p>Hence, there was little poverty, or such only as
was endurable, for the love of one's neighbor had to
be exercised with the greatest conscientiousness to
keep the favor of God, the King. Finally, a large
space was accorded to gladness. Thrice a year and
on other occasions the people were to assemble at
festivals, not to revel in sensual enjoyments, but to
accustom themselves to follow God gladly; for
there is no more effectual means of guiding the
hearts of men than the joy which arises from love
and admiration.</p>

<p>After Spinoza had depicted Israel's theocracy
quite as a pattern for all states, he was apparently
startled at having imparted so much light to the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_106" id="Page_106">106</a></span>
picture, and he looked around for shade. Instead
of answering in a purely historical manner the questions,
whence it came that the Hebrews were so
often subdued, and why their state was entirely destroyed;
instead of indicating that these wholesome
laws remained a never realized ideal, Spinoza suggests
a sophistic solution. Because God did not
wish to make Israel's dominion lasting, he gave bad
laws and statutes. Spinoza supports this view by a
verse which he misunderstood. These bad laws,
rebellion against the sacerdotal state, coupled with
bad morals, produced discontent, revolt, and insurrection.
At last matters went so far, that instead
of the Divine King, the Israelites chose a human
one, and instead of the temple, a court. Monarchy,
however, only increased the disorder; it could not
endure the state within the state, the high-priesthood,
and lowered the dignity of the latter by the
introduction of strange worship. The prophets
could avail nothing, because they only declaimed
against the tyrants, but could not remove the cause
of the evils. All things combined brought on the
destruction of the divine state. With its destruction
by the Babylonian king, the natural rights of
the Israelites were transferred to the conqueror, and
they were bound to obey him and his successors, as
they had obeyed God. All the laws of Judaism,
nay, the whole of Judaism, was thereby abolished,
and no longer had any significance. This was the
result of Spinoza's inquiry in his "Theologico-Political
Treatise." Judaism had a brilliant past,
God concluded an alliance with the people, showed
to them His exalted power, and gave them excellent
laws; but He did not intend Israel's pre√´minence
to be permanent, therefore He also gave bad
laws. Consequently, Judaism reached its end more
than two thousand years ago, and yet it continued
its existence! Wonderful! Spinoza found the
history of Israel and the constitution of the state<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_107" id="Page_107">107</a></span>
excellent during the barbarism of the period of the
Judges, while the brilliant epochs of David and Solomon
and of King Uzziah remained inexplicable to
him. And, above all, the era of the second Temple,
the Maccabean epoch, when the Jewish nation rose
from shameful degradation to a brilliant height, and
brought the heathen world itself to worship the one
God and adopt a moral life, remained to Spinoza an
insoluble riddle. This shows that his whole demonstration
and his analysis (schematism) cannot
stand the test of criticism, but rests on false
assumptions.</p>

<p>Spinoza might have brought Judaism into extreme
peril; for he not only furnished its opponents with the
weapons of reason to combat Judaism more effectually,
but also conceded to every state and magistrate
the right to suppress it and use force against
its followers, to which they ought meekly to submit.
The funeral piles of the Inquisition for Marranos
were, according to Spinoza's system, doubly justified;
citizens have no right on rational grounds to resist
the recognized religion of the state, and it is folly to
profess Judaism and to sacrifice oneself for it. But
a peculiar trait of Spinoza's character stood Judaism
in good stead. He loved peace and quiet too well
to become a propagandist for his critical principles.
"To be peaceable and peaceful" was his ideal;
avoidance of conflict and opposition was at once his
strength and his weakness. To his life's end he led
an ideally-philosophical life; for food, clothing, and
shelter, he needed only so much as he could earn
with his handicraft of polishing lenses, which his
friends disposed of. He struggled against accepting
a pension, customarily bestowed on learned men
at that time, even from his sincere and rich admirers,
Simon de Vries and the grand pensionary De Witt,
that he might not fall into dependence, constraint,
and disquiet. By reason of this invincible desire for
philosophic calm and freedom from care, he would<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_108" id="Page_108">108</a></span>
not decide in favor of either of the political parties,
then setting the States General in feverish agitation.
Not even the exciting murder of his friend John de
Witt was able to hurry him into partisanship. Spinoza
bewailed his high and noble friend, but did not
defend his honor, to clear it of suspicion. When the
most highly cultivated German prince of his time,
Count-Palatine Karl Ludwig, who cherished a certain
affection for Jews, offered him, "the Protestant
Jew," as he was still called, the chair of philosophy
in the University of Heidelberg under very favorable
conditions, Spinoza declined the offer. He did
not conceal his reason: he would not surrender his
quietude. From this predominant tendency, or,
rather, from fear of disturbance and inconveniences
and from apprehension of calling enemies down
upon him, or of coming into collision with the state,
he refused to publish his speculations for a long time.
When at last he resolved, on the pressure of friends,
to send "The Theologico-Political Treatise" to
press, he did not put his name to the work, which
made an epoch in literature, and even caused
a false place of publication, viz., Hamburg, to be
printed on the title-page, in order to obliterate every
trace of its real authorship. He almost denied his
offspring, to avoid being disturbed.</p>

<p>As might have been foreseen, the appearance of
"The Theologico-Political Treatise" (1670), made
an extraordinary stir. No one had written so distinctly
and incisively concerning the relation of
religion to philosophy and the power of the state,
and, above all, had so sharply condemned the clergy.
The ministers of all denominations were extraordinarily
excited against this "godless" book, as it
was called, which disparaged revealed religion. Spinoza's
influential friends were not able to protect it;
it was condemned by a decree of the States General,
and forbidden to be sold&mdash;which only caused it to
be read more eagerly. But Spinoza was the more<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_109" id="Page_109">109</a></span>
reluctant to publish his other writings, especially his
philosophical system. With all his strength of
character, he did not belong to those bold spirits,
who undertake to be the pioneers of truth, who usher
it into the world with loud voice, and win it adherents,
unconcerned as to whether they may have to
endure bloody or bloodless martyrdom. In the unselfishness
of Spinoza's character and system there
lurked an element of selfishness, namely, the desire
to be disturbed as little as possible in the attainment
of knowledge, in the happiness of contemplation,
and in reflection upon the universe and the
chain of causes and effects which prevail in it. A
challenge to action, effort, and resistance to opposition
lay neither in Spinoza's temper, nor in his
philosophy.</p>

<p>In this apparently harmless feature lay also the
reason that his most powerful and vehemently conducted
attacks upon Judaism made no deep impression,
and called forth no great commotion in the
Jewish world. At the time when Spinoza threw
down the challenge to Judaism, a degree of culture
and science prevailed in the Jewish-Portuguese
circle, unknown either before or after; there reigned
in the community of Amsterdam and its colonies a
literary activity and fecundity, which might be called
classical, if the merit of the literary productions had
corresponded with their compass. The authors
were chiefly cultivated Marranos, who had escaped
from the Spanish or Portuguese prisons of the Inquisition
to devote themselves in free Holland to their
faith and free inquiry. There were philosophers,
physicians, mathematicians, philologists, poets, even
poetesses. Many of these Marranos who escaped
to Amsterdam had gone through peculiar vicissitudes.
A monk of Valencia, Fray Vincent de Rocamora
(1601&ndash;1684), had been eminent in Catholic theology.
He had been made confessor to the Infanta
Maria, afterwards empress of Germany and a persecutor<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_110" id="Page_110">110</a></span>
of the Jews. One day the confessor fled
from Spain, reached Amsterdam, declared himself
as Isaac de Rocamora, studied medicine at the age
of forty, and became the happy father of a family
and president of Jewish benevolent institutions.
The quondam monk, afterwards Parnass (president
of the community), was also a good poet, and wrote
admirable Spanish and Latin verses.</p>

<p>Enrique Enriquez de Paz of Segovia (1600&ndash;1660),
the Jewish Calderon, had a very different career.
Having entered the army while young, he behaved
so gallantly that he won the order of San Miguel,
and was made captain. Besides the sword, he
wielded the pen, with which he described comic figures
and situations. Enriquez de Paz, or, as he
was styled in his poetical capacity, Antonio Enriquez
de Gomez, composed more than two and
twenty comedies, some of which were put upon the
stage at Madrid, and, being taken for Calderon's productions,
were received with much applause. Neither
Mars nor the Muses succeeded in protecting him
against the Inquisition; he could escape its clutches
only by rapid flight. He lived a long time in France.
His prolific muse celebrated Louis XIV, the queen
of France, the powerful statesman Richelieu, and
other high personages of the court. He bewailed
in elegies his misfortunes and the loss of his country,
which he loved like a son, step-mother though she
had been to him. Although blessed by fortune,
Enriquez de Paz felt himself unhappy in the rude
north, far from the blue mountains and mild air of
Spain. He lamented:</p>

<blockquote>

<p>"I have won for myself wealth and traveled over many seas, and
heaped up ever fresh treasures by thousands; now my hair is
bleached, my beard as snowy white as my silver bars, the reward of
my labors."</p></blockquote>

<p>He lived in France, too, as a Christian, but proclaimed
his sympathy with Judaism by mourning in
elegiac verses the martyrdom of Lope de Vera y<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_111" id="Page_111">111</a></span>
Alarcon. Finally he settled down in the asylum of
the Marranos, whilst his effigy was burnt on the funeral
pile at Seville. There had been again a great
auto-da-f√© (1660) of sixty Marranos, of whom four
were first strangled and then burned, whilst three
were burned alive. Effigies of escaped Marranos
were borne along in procession, and thrown into
the flames&mdash;amongst them that of the knight of
San Miguel, the writer of comedies. A new-Christian,
who was present at this horrible sight,
and soon after escaped to Amsterdam, met Gomez
in the street, and exclaimed excitedly: "Ah!
Se√±or Gomez! I saw your effigy burn on the
funeral pile at Seville!" "Well," he replied, "they
are welcome to it." Along with his numerous secular
poems, Enriquez Gomez left one of Jewish
national interest in celebration of the hero-judge
Samson. The laurels which the older Spanish
poet Miguel Silveyra, also a Marrano, whom he
admired, had won by his epic, "The Maccabee,"
haunted him until he had brought out a companion
piece. To the blind hero who avenged himself on
the Philistines by his very death, Gomez assigned
verses which expressed his own heart:</p>

<div class="poem-container">
<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="iq">"I die for Thy holy word, for Thy religion,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">For Thy doctrine, Thy hallowed commandments,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">For the nation adopted by Thy choice,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">For Thy sublime ordinance I die."<br /></span>
</div></div>
</div>

<p>Another point of view is presented by two emigrant
Marranos of this period, father and son, the
two Pensos, the one rich in possessions and charity,
the other in poetical gifts. They probably sprang
from Espejo, in the province of Cordova, escaped
from the fury of the Inquisition, and at last settled,
after many changes of residence, as Jews in Amsterdam.
Isaac Penso (died 1683) the elder, a
banker, was a father to the poor. He spent a tithe
of the income from his property on the poor, and
distributed, up to his death, 40,000 gulden. His<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_112" id="Page_112">112</a></span>
decease aroused deep regret in the community of
Amsterdam. His son (Felice) Joseph Penso, also
called De la Vega from his mother's family (1650&ndash;1703),
was a rich merchant, and turned his attention
to poetry. A youth of seventeen, he awoke
the long-slumbering echo of neo-Hebraic poesy,
and caused it to strike its highest note. Joseph
Penso boldly undertook a most difficult task; he
composed a Hebrew drama. Since Immanuel
Romi had written his witty tales in verse, the neo-Hebraic
muse had been stricken with sterility, for
which the increasing troubles of the times were not
alone to blame. Moses da Rieti and the poetic
school of Salonica composed verses, but did not
write poetry. Even the greatest of Jewish poets,
Gebirol and Jehuda Halevi, had produced only lyric
and didactic poetry, and had not thought of the
drama. Joseph Penso, inspired by the poetical air
of Spain, the land of his birth, where Lope de
Vega's and Calderon's melodious verses were
heard beside the litany of the monks and the cry of
the sacrificial victims, transferred Spanish art
forms to neo-Hebraic poetry. Penso happily imitated
the various kinds of metre and strophe of
European poetry in the language of David and
Isaiah.</p>

<p>One may not, indeed, apply a severe standard to
Joseph Penso's drama, but should endeavor to forget
that long before him Shakespeare had created
life-like forms and interests. For, measured by
these, Penso's dramatic monologue and dialogue
seem puerile. However free from blame his versification
is, the invention is poor, the ideas commonplace.
A king who takes a serious view of his responsibilities
as ruler is led astray, now by his own
impulses (Yezer), now by a coquette (Isha), now by
Satan. Three other opposing forces endeavor to
lead him in the right way&mdash;his own judgment
(Sechel), divine inspiration (Hashgacha), and an<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_113" id="Page_113">113</a></span>
angel. These are the characters in Penso's drama
"The Captives of Hope" (Asir√© ha-Tikwah). But
if one takes into consideration the object which
Penso had in view, viz., to hold up a mirror to Marrano
youths settled at Amsterdam, who had been
used to Spanish licentiousness, and to picture to
them the high value of a virtuous life, the performance
of the youthful poet is not to be despised.
Joseph Penso de la Vega composed a large number
of verses in Spanish, occasional poetry, moral and
philosophical reflections, and eulogies on princes.
His novels, entitled "The Dangerous Courses"
(los Rumbos peligrosos), were popular.</p>

<p>Marrano poets of mediocre ability were so numerous
at this time in Amsterdam, that one of them,
the Spanish resident in the Netherlands, Manuel
Belmonte (Isaac Nu√±es), appointed count-palatine,
founded an academy of poetry. Poetical works
were to be handed in, and as judges he appointed
the former confessor, De Rocamora, and another
Marrano, who composed Latin verses, Isaac Gomez
de Sosa. The latter was so much enraptured of
Penso's Hebrew drama, that he triumphantly proclaimed,
in Latin verse:</p>

<blockquote>

<p>"Now is it at length attained! The Hebrew Muse strides along on
high-heeled buskin safe and sound. With the measured step of
poetry she is conducted auspiciously by Joseph&mdash;sprung from that
race which still is mostly in captivity. Lo! a clear beam of hope
shines afresh, that now even the stage may be opened to sacred song.
Yet why do I praise him? The poet is celebrated by his own poetry,
and his own work proclaims the praise of the master."</p></blockquote>

<p>Another of the friends of the Jewish dramatist
was Nicolas de Oliver y Fullana (Daniel Jehuda),
poet, and colonel in the Spanish service; he was
knighted, entered the service of Holland, and was
an accurate cartographer and cosmographer. There
was also Joseph Szemach (Sameh) Arias, a man of
high military rank, who translated into Spanish the
work of the historian Josephus against Apion, which
controverted the old prejudices and falsehoods<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_114" id="Page_114">114</a></span>
against Jews. This polemic was not superfluous
even at this time. Of the Jewish Marrano poetesses,
it will suffice to name the fair and gifted
Isabel Correa (Rebecca), who twined a wreath of
various poems, and translated the Italian popular
drama, "The True Shepherd" (Pastor Fido, by
Guarini) into beautiful Spanish verse. Isabel was
the second wife of the poet-warrior, De Oliver y
Fullana.</p>

<p>Of a far different stamp was the Marrano
Thomas de Pinedo (Isaac, 1614&ndash;1679) of Portugal,
educated in a Jesuit college at Madrid. He was
more at home in classical than in Jewish antiquity,
and applied himself to a branch of study little cultivated
in Spain in his time, that of ancient geography.
He, too, was driven out of Spain by the Inquisition,
and deemed himself fortunate to have
escaped unhurt. The philologist De Pinedo dwelt
later on in Amsterdam, where he printed his comprehensive
work. He composed his own epitaph
in Latin.</p>

<p>We must not leave unmentioned a personage
celebrated at that time perhaps beyond his deserts,
Jacob Jehuda Leon (Templo, 1603&ndash;1671). If not a
Marrano, he was of Marrano descent, and resided
first at Middelburg, then at Amsterdam, and was
more an artist than a man of science. Leon devoted
himself to the reproduction of the first Temple
and its vessels, as they are described in the
Bible and the Talmud. He executed a model of
the Temple on a reduced scale (3 yards square, 1¬Ω
in height), and added a concise, clear description in
Spanish and Hebrew. Work of so unusual a character
attracted extraordinary notice at a time when
every kind of antiquarian learning, especially biblical,
was highly prized. The government of Holland
and Zealand gave the author the copyright
privilege. Duke August of Brunswick, and his wife
Elizabeth, wished to possess a German translation<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_115" id="Page_115">115</a></span>
of Leon's description, and commissioned Professor
John Saubert, of Helmst√§dt, to undertake it. While
corresponding with the author so as to ensure
thoroughness, he was anticipated by another man
who brought out a German translation at Hanover.
This circumstance caused great annoyance to Professor
Saubert. Templo, as Leon and his posterity
were surnamed from his work in connection with
the Temple, engaged in controversies with Christian
ecclesiastics on Judaism and Christianity, and
published a translation of the Psalms in Spanish.</p>

<p>In this cultivated circle of Spinoza's contemporaries
were two men who lived alternately at Hamburg
and Amsterdam, David Coen de Lara and
Dionysius Musaphia, both distinguished as philologists,
but not for much besides. With their knowledge
of Latin and Greek they explained the dialect
of the Talmud, and corrected errors which had crept
into the earlier Talmudical lexicons. David de
Lara (1610&ndash;1674) was also a preacher and writer on
morals; but his efforts in that direction are of small
value. He associated too much with the Hamburg
preacher, Esdras Edzardus, who was bent on the
conversion of the Jews. The latter spread the
false report that De Lara was almost a Christian
before he died. Dionysius (Benjamin) Musaphia
(born about 1616, died at Amsterdam, 1676), a physician
and student of natural science, was up to the
date of the monarch's death in the service of the
Danish king Christian IV. He was also a philosopher,
and allowed himself to question various things
in the Talmud and the Bible. Nevertheless he held
the office of rabbi at Amsterdam in his old age.</p>

<p>Much more important than the whole of this circle
was Balthasar Orobio de Castro (1620&ndash;1687).
He also sprang from Marrano parents, who secretly
continued to cling to Judaism, in that they abstained
from food and drink on the Day of Atonement. In
this meager conception of Judaism, Orobio was<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_116" id="Page_116">116</a></span>
brought up. Endowed with clear intellect, he
studied the decayed and antiquated philosophy still
taught in Spanish academies, and became professor
of metaphysics in the University of Salamanca.
This fossilized philosophy appears neither to have
satisfied him nor to have brought him sufficient
means of subsistence, for he applied himself in riper
years to the study of medicine. In this pursuit
Orobio was more successful; he gained a reputation
at Seville, was physician to the duke of Medina-Celi,
and to a family in high favor with the court,
and amassed considerable wealth. He was a happy
husband and father, when the Inquisition cast its
baleful glance upon him. A servant, whom he had
punished for theft, had informed against him.
Orobio was seized, accused of Judaism, and thrown
into a narrow, gloomy dungeon, where he had not
room to move, and where he spent three years
(about 1655&ndash;1658).</p>

<p>At first he filled up his time with philosophical
subtleties, as pursued at the Spanish universities.
He undertook to defend a thesis, acting at the same
time in imagination as the opponent, who interposes
objections, and as the judge, who sums up and sifts
the arguments. By degrees his mind grew so perplexed
that he often asked himself, "Am I really
Don Balthasar Orobio, who went about in the streets
of Seville, and lived in comfort with his family?"
His past seemed a dream, and he believed that he
had been born in prison, and must die there. But
the tribunal of the Inquisition brought a change into
his empty dream-life. He was ushered into a dark
vault, lighted only by a dull lamp. He could hardly
distinguish the judge, the secretary, and the executioner,
who were about to deal with his case. Having
been again admonished to confess his heresy,
and having again denied it, the hangman undressed
him, bound him with cords, which were fastened to
hooks in the wall, brought his body into a swinging<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_117" id="Page_117">117</a></span>
movement between the ceiling and the floor, and
drew the cords so tight, that the blood spurted from
his nails. His feet, moreover, were strongly bound
to a small ladder, the steps of which were studded
with spikes. Whilst being tortured, he was frequently
admonished to make confession, and was
threatened, in case he persisted in denial, with the
infliction of still more horrible pains, for which,
though they caused his death, he would have to
thank his own obstinacy, not the tribunal. However,
he survived the torture, was taken back to prison
to allow his wounds to heal, then condemned to
wear the garb of shame (San Benito), and was finally
banished from Spain. He betook himself to Toulouse,
where he became professor of medicine in the
university. Although respected in his new position,
Orobio could not long endure the hypocrisy. He
went to Amsterdam, publicly professed the Jewish
religion, and assumed the name of Isaac (about
1666). No wonder that he became a bitter opponent
of Christianity, which he had learnt to know
thoroughly. He became an adherent of Judaism
from conviction, proved himself a courageous and
able champion of the religion of his fathers, and
dealt such powerful blows to Christianity as few
before him, so that a distinguished Protestant theologian
(Van Limborch) felt compelled to reply to
Orobio's attacks.</p>

<p>All these cultivated youths and men, the soldier-poets
Enriquez Gomez, Nicholas de Oliver y
Fullana, and Joseph Arias, and the writers Joseph
Penso, Thomas de Pinedo, Jacob Leon, David de
Lara, and Dionysius Musaphia, knew of Spinoza's
attacks upon Judaism, and undoubtedly read his
"Theologico-Political Treatise." Isaac Orobio associated
with Spinoza. Yet the blows by which
the latter strove to shake Judaism did not cause
the former to waver in their convictions. This is
the more remarkable, as simultaneously, from<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_118" id="Page_118">118</a></span>
another side, Judaism was covered with shame, or,
what comes to the same thing, its followers everywhere
in the East and West, with few exceptions,
became slaves to a delusion which exposed them to
the ridicule of the world, and enveloped them for
the first time in the darkness of the Middle Ages.</p>

<p>Without suspecting it, Spinoza possessed in the
East an ally, diametrically his opposite, who labored
to disintegrate Judaism, and succeeded in throwing
the whole Jewish race into a turmoil, which long
interfered with its progress. Sabbata√Ø Zevi was at
once Spinoza's opposite and his ally. He possessed
many more admirers than the philosopher of Amsterdam,
became for a space the idol of the Jewish race,
and has secret adherents even to the present time.
Sabbata√Ø Zevi (born Ab 9, 1626, died 1676), of
Smyrna, in Asia Minor, was of Spanish descent, and
became the originator of a new Messianic frenzy,
the founder of a new sect. He owed the attachment
which he inspired even as a youth, not to his
qualities of mind, but to his external appearance and
attractive manner. He was tall, well formed, had
fine dark hair, a fine beard, and a pleasant voice,
which won hearts by speech and still more by song.
But his mind was befogged by reason of the predominance
of fancy; he had an enthusiastic temperament
and an inclination to what was strange,
especially to solitude. In boyhood Sabbata√Ø Zevi
avoided the company and games of playmates,
sought solitary places, and what usually has charms
for the young did not attract him. He was educated
by the current method. In early youth he studied
the Talmud in the school of the veteran Joseph
Eskapha, a staunch Talmudist of Smyrna, but did
not attain to great proficiency. The more was
he attracted by the confused jumble of the Kabbala.
Once introduced into the labyrinth of the
Zohar, he felt himself at home therein, guided by
Lurya's interpretation. Sabbata√Ø Zevi shared the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_119" id="Page_119">119</a></span>
prevailing opinion that the Kabbala can be acquired
only by means of asceticism. He mortified his body,
and bathed very frequently in the sea, day and night,
winter and summer. Perhaps it was from sea-bathing
that his body derived the peculiar fragrance
which his worshipers strongly maintained that it
possessed. In early manhood he presented a contrast
to his companions because he felt no attraction
to the female sex. According to custom Sabbata√Ø
Zevi married early, but avoided his young, good-looking
wife so pertinaciously, that she applied for
divorce, which he willingly granted her. The same
thing happened with a second wife.</p>

<p>This aversion to marriage, rare in the warm
climate of the East, his assiduous study of the
Kabbala, and his ascetic life, attracted attention.
Disciples sought him, and were introduced by him
to the Kabbala. Twenty years old he was the
master of a small circle. He attached disciples to
himself partly by his earnest and retiring manner,
which precluded familiarity, partly by his musical
voice, with which he sang in Spanish the Kabbalistic
verses composed by Lurya or himself. Another
circumstance must be added. When Sultan Ibrahim
ascended the throne, a violent war broke out
between Turkey and Venice, which made the trade
of the Levant unsafe in the capital. Several European,
that is, Dutch and English, mercantile houses
in consequence transferred their offices to Smyrna.
This hitherto insignificant city thereby acquired
importance as a mart. The Jews of Smyrna, who
had been poor, profited by this commercial development,
and amassed great riches, first as agents of
large houses, afterwards as independent firms.
Mordecai Zevi, Sabbata√Ø's father, from the Morea,
originally poor, became the Smyrna agent of an
English house, executed its commissions with strict
honesty, enjoyed the confidence of the principals,
and became a wealthy man. His increasing prosperity<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_120" id="Page_120">120</a></span>
was attributed by the blind father to the
merit of his Kabbala-loving son, to whom he paid
such great reverence, that it was communicated to
strangers. Sabbata√Ø was regarded as a young saint.
The more discreet, on account of his folly, declared
him to be mad. In the house of his English principal,
Mordecai Zevi often heard the approach of
the millennium discussed, either he himself or some
of his people being enthusiastic believers in the
apocalypse of the Fifth Monarchy. The year 1666
was designated by these enthusiasts as the Messianic
year, which was to bring renewed splendor to
the Jews and see their return to Jerusalem. The
expectations heard in the English counting house
were communicated by Mordecai Zevi to the members
of his family, none of whom listened more attentively
than Sabbata√Ø, already entangled in the maze
of the Luryan Kabbala, and inclined to mistake
enthusiastic hopes for prosaic fact. What if he
himself were called upon to usher in this time of
redemption? Had he not, at an earlier age than
any one before, penetrated to the heart of the Kabbala?
And who could be more worthy of this call
than one deeply immersed in its mysteries?</p>

<p>The central point of the later Kabbala was most
intense expectation of the Messiah; Lurya, Vital,
and their disciples and followers proclaimed anew,
"The kingdom of heaven is at hand." A peculiar
redemption was to precede and accompany it&mdash;the
redemption of the scattered elements of the original
soul (Nizuzoth) from the fetters of original evil, the
demon nature (Kelifoth), which, taking a hold on
men through the fall of the angels or divine
elements, held them in captivity, impeded their
upward flight, and necessitated the perpetual transmigration
of souls from body to body. As soon as
the evil spirit was either consumed, annihilated, rendered
powerless, or at least existed by itself without
admixture of the divine, then the Kabbalistic<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_121" id="Page_121">121</a></span>
order (Olam ha-Tikkun) would prevail, streams of
mercy would pour forth without let or hindrance
upon the lower world through the channels of the
Sefiroth, and fructify and miraculously quicken it.
This work of redemption can be accomplished by
every truly pious man (Zaddik), who having an enlightened
soul, and being initiated into the Kabbala,
stands in close union with the world of spirits, comprehends
the connection between the upper and
lower world, and fulfills all religious exercises
(Kewanoth) with concentrated devotion and with
due regard to their influence upon the higher powers.
Still more effectually the Messiah, the son of
David, will accomplish the annihilation of demoniacal
powers and the restoration of lost souls, or rather
the collection of the scattered elements of the universal
soul of Adam. For to the Messiah, in whom
dwells a pure, immaculate soul, are unfolded the
mysterious depths of the higher worlds, essences,
and divine creation, even the Divine Being Himself.
The Messiah of the seed of David would, to a certain
extent, be the original man (Adam Kadmon)
incarnate, part of the Godhead.</p>

<p>This Luryan mysticism dazzled the bewildered
brain of the Smyrna youth, and produced such confusion
and giddiness, that he thought he could easily
usher in this spiritual redemption, which would be
immediately followed by that of the body. In what
manner this haughty wish to play the part of a Messiah
germinates and breaks forth in enthusiastic
minds, is an impenetrable riddle. Sabbata√Ø Zevi
was not the first to believe himself able to reverse
the whole order of the world, by mystical hocus-pocus,
and partly to succeed in the endeavor. Certain
it is that the extravagant notions entertained
by Jews and Christians with regard to the near approach
of the time of grace worked upon Sabbata√Ø's
weak brain. That book of falsehoods, the Zohar,
declared that in the year of the world 5408 (1648)<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_122" id="Page_122">122</a></span>
the era of redemption would dawn, and precisely in
that year Sabbata√Ø revealed himself to his train of
youthful companions as the Messianic redeemer.
It happened in an apparently insignificant manner,
but the mode of revelation was of great import to
the initiated. Sabbata√Ø Zevi uttered the full four-lettered
name of God in Hebrew (Jhwh, the Tetra-grammaton)
without hesitation, although this was
strictly prohibited in the Talmud and by the usage
of ages. The Kabbalists attached all sorts of mystical
importance to this prohibition. During the
dispersion of Israel, the perfection of God Himself
was to a certain extent destroyed, on account of the
sinfulness of men and the degradation of the Jewish
people, since the Deity could not carry out His
moral plan. The higher and lower worlds were
divided from each other by a deep gulf; the four
letters of God's name were parted asunder. With
the Messianic period of redemption the moral order
of the world, as God had laid it down in the plan of
the universe, and the perfection and unity of God
would be restored. When Sabbata√Ø Zevi permitted
himself to pronounce the name of God in full, he
thereby proclaimed that the time of grace had begun
with him.</p>

<p>However, despite his pious, mystical life, he had
too little authority at the age of two and twenty for
the rabbis to allow an infraction of the existing
order of things, which might lead to further inroads.
When Zevi's pretensions became known some years
later, the college of rabbis, at their head his teacher
Joseph Eskapha, laid him and his followers under a
ban. Many bickerings ensued in the community,
the particulars of which are not known. Finally he
and his disciples were banished from Smyrna (about
1651). The Messianic delusion appeared to have
been extinguished, but it smouldered on, and broke
out again, about fifteen years later, in a bright, consuming
flame. This persecution, far from terrifying<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_123" id="Page_123">123</a></span>
Sabbata√Ø Zevi, gave him a sense of his dignity. The
idea of a suffering Messiah had been transplanted
from Christianity to Judaism; it was the accepted
view that humiliation was the precursor of the Messiah's
exaltation and glorification. Sabbata√Ø believed
in himself, and his disciples, amongst them Moses
Pinheiro, a man of mature age, highly esteemed for
scientific acquirements, shared the belief with
tenacity. If the Messiah had been obliged to beg
his way through the world, his illusion would not have
long held its ground. But Sabbata√Ø was richly provided
with means, he could maintain his independence
and his presumed dignity, and win adherents to
his cause. At first, however, he kept himself in
concealment, did not say much about his Messiahship,
and thereby escaped ridicule. Whither he betook
himself after his banishment from his native
city is not quite certain; probably to the Turkish
capital, where dwelt the largest Jewish community,
in which were so many clean and unclean elements,
that everyone could find companions for plans and
adventures. Here he made the acquaintance of a
preacher, Abraham Yachini, who confirmed him in
his delusion. Yachini stood in high repute on account
of his talent as a preacher. He was a needy
and artful fellow, and made neat transcriptions for a
Dutch Christian, who dabbled in Oriental literature.
From selfish motives or delight in mystification, and
to confirm Sabbata√Ø Zevi in his delusion, Yachini
palmed off upon him an apocryphal manuscript in
archaic characters, which he alleged bore ancient
testimony to Sabbata√Ø's Messiahship.</p>

<blockquote>

<p>"I, Abraham, was shut up for forty years in a cave, and wondered
that the time of miracles did not make its appearance. Then a voice
replied to me, 'A son shall be born in the year of the world 5386
(1626), and be called Sabbata√Ø. He shall quell the great dragon: he
is the true Messiah, and shall wage war without weapons.'"</p></blockquote>

<p>This document, which the young fanatic himself
appears to have taken for a genuine revelation,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_124" id="Page_124">124</a></span>
became later on the source of many mystifications
and impostures. However, it appeared inadvisable
to the dupe and the deceiver that he should appear
in Constantinople. Salonica, which had always paid
homage to mysticism, seemed a more suitable field
for Kabbalistic extravagances. Here, therefore,
Sabbata√Ø resided for some time, gained adherents,
and came forward with greater boldness. Here he
enacted one of his favorite scenes, by which he afterwards
worked upon the imagination of the Kabbalists.
He prepared a solemn festival, invited his
friends, sent for the sacred book (Torah), and intimated
to those present, that he was about to celebrate
his mystical marriage with it. In the language
of the Kabbala this meant that the Torah, the
daughter of heaven, was to be united indissolubly
with the Messiah, the son of heaven, or En-Sof.
This scene displeased the discreet rabbis of Salonica,
and they decreed his banishment. Thence he betook
himself to the Morea, probably to relatives and
friends of his father, and resided for some time at
Athens, where at that time there was a Jewish community.
When the Jews of this region heard of the
sentence pronounced upon him, they gave him no
encouragement. This opposition, far from discouraging
him, only served to make him bolder; he
probably regarded his sufferings as necessary for
the glorification of the Messiah.</p>

<p>At last, after long wandering, a prospect of realizing
his dream presented itself at Cairo. In the
Egyptian capital there was a Jewish mint-master
and tax-farmer, with the title of Saraph-Bashi, similar
to the Alabarchs at Alexandria in earlier ages. At
that time (after 1656) the office was held by Raphael
Joseph Chelebi, of Aleppo, a man of great wealth
and open-handed benevolence, but of unspeakable
credulity, and ineradicable propensity to mysticism
and asceticism. Fifty learned Talmudists and Kabbalists
were supported by him, and dined at his<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_125" id="Page_125">125</a></span>
table. Everyone who sought his compassion found
help and relief in his need. While riding in the
royal chariot, and appearing in splendid robes, he
wore sackcloth underneath, fasted and bathed much,
and frequently at night scourged himself. Samuel
Vital, a son of Chayim Calabrese, superintended his
constant penances according to the Kabbalistic precepts
of Lurya (Tikkun Lurya). These were intended,
as has been stated, to hasten the coming of
the Messiah. To be in Cairo and not to make
Raphael Joseph's acquaintance was an inconceivable
course for a Kabbalist. Sabbata√Ø Zevi thus came
into his circle, and won his confidence the sooner,
as, owing to his independent position, he did not
desire anything of him. He appears to have partially
revealed his Messianic plans to Raphael. He
had grown older, maturer, and wiser, and knew how
to make men amenable to his wishes. The Apocalyptic
year, 1666, was drawing near, and it was
important to use the auspicious moment.</p>

<p>He betook himself to Jerusalem, perhaps under
the delusion that in the Holy Land a miracle would
take place to confirm his greatness. The community
at Jerusalem was at that time in every way
poor and wretched. Besides being ground down
by the oppressions and extortions of Turkish officials,
it suffered because the supplies from Europe
were exhausted on account of the constant massacres
of the Jews in Poland. The consequence was that
the best men emigrated, leaving the government of
the community to thorough-going Kabbalists, devoted
adherents of Lurya and Vital, or to a licentious
set, who followed the impulses of bare-faced
selfishness. There were at that time very few men
of repute and authority in Jerusalem. A Marrano
physician named Jacob Zemach appears to have
stood at their head. He had leapt, so to speak, in
one bound from a Portuguese church into the nest
of Kabbalists at Safet, and there, as later at Jerusalem,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_126" id="Page_126">126</a></span>
had become an unconscious tool for the
mystifications practiced by Vital. Abraham Amigo,
a Talmudist of the second or third rank, had similar
aims. A man of some importance, to be sure, was
Jacob Chages (1620&ndash;1674), who had migrated from
Italy to Jerusalem, and who wrote Spanish well.
Chages, however, had no official position, but lived
the life of a recluse in an academy, which two brothers
named Vega, of Leghorn, had founded for him.
The thoughtless credulity of the people of Jerusalem
of that time is instanced by the gross deception
practiced upon them by Baruch Gad, one of their
alms-collecting emissaries, which they, the learned
and the unlearned, not only credited, but swore to
as true. Baruch Gad had gone on a begging journey
to Persia, where he pretended that he had
experienced many adventures, and had been saved
by a Jew of the tribe of Naphtali, who had given him
a Kabbalistic letter from one of the "Sons of Moses"
at the miraculous river Sabbation. It contained
much about the riches, splendor, and daily miracles
of the Sons of Moses, and said that they were
momentarily awaiting the commencement of the
Messianic epoch as a signal for coming forth. This
story, certified by a circular, was brought by Baruch
Gad to Jerusalem, where it found unquestioning credence.
When the community of Jerusalem had
fallen into great want in consequence of the Cossack
massacre, ten so-called rabbis, Jacob Zemach at
their head, sent to Reggio to their envoy Nathan
Spira, of Jerusalem, a copy of this document from
the Sons of Moses, which was kept in careful custody.
It was to serve as a bait to draw more
abundant alms.</p>

<p>The miracle which Sabbata√Ø Zevi was expecting
for himself in the Holy City was present in the credulity
and mania for miracles on the part of the
people of Jerusalem, who were inclined, like the
lowest savages, to accept any absurd message as a<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_127" id="Page_127">127</a></span>
divine revelation, if only it was brought before them
in the right manner. At first the Smyrna enthusiast
kept himself quiet, and gave no offense. He
lived according to the precepts of the Kabbala,
imposed the severest mortifications on himself, and
often stayed by the graves of pious men in order to
draw down their spirits. Thereby, aided by his pleasing,
attractive, and reverential behavior and taciturn
manner, he gradually gathered round him a circle of
adherents who had blind faith in him. One of his
devoted followers related with credulous simplicity,
that Sabbata√Ø Zevi shed floods of tears in prayer.
He sang Psalms the whole night with his melodious
voice, while pacing the room now with short, now
with long strides. His whole conduct was out of
the ordinary groove. He was also wont to sing
coarse love songs in Spanish, with a mystical meaning,
about the emperor's fair daughter Melisselda,
with her coral lips and milk-white skin, as she rose
out of the bath. Sabbata√Ø used another means to
win hearts. When he showed himself in the streets
he distributed sweet-meats of all sorts to the children,
who in consequence ran after him, and he
thus gained the favor of their mothers.</p>

<p>An incident brought his eccentric ideas nearer
their realization. The community at Jerusalem was
sentenced by one of the pachas or some minor official
to one of those oppressive exactions which frequently
carried torture or death in their train. The
impoverished members rested their hopes solely
on Raphael Joseph Chelebi at Cairo, known to have
the means and inclination to succor his afflicted
brethren, especially the saints of Jerusalem. A
messenger was to be sent to him, and Sabbata√Ø Zevi
was universally regarded as the most fitting, particularly
as he was a favorite with the Saraph-Bashi.
He undertook this task willingly, because he hoped
to get the opportunity to play the part of saviour of
the Holy City. His worshipers date from this journey<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_128" id="Page_128">128</a></span>
to Egypt the beginning of his miraculous power,
and assert that he accomplished many miracles at
sea. Sabbata√Ø however traveled not by water, but
by land, by way of Hebron and Gaza, probably joining
a caravan through the desert. He excited so
much attention that all the Jews of Hebron, in order
to observe him, refrained from sleep during the
night of his stay. Arrived at Cairo, he immediately
received from Chelebi the sum required for the
ransom of the community at Jerusalem, and, besides,
an extraordinarily favorable opportunity presented
itself to confirm his Messianic dreams.</p>

<p>During the massacre of the Jews in Poland by
Chmielnicki, a Jewish orphan girl of about six was
found by Christians, and put into a nunnery. Her
parents were dead, a brother had been driven to
Amsterdam, the whole community broken up and
put to flight, and no one troubled himself about the
forsaken child, so that the nuns of the convent regarded
the foundling as a soul brought to them and
gave her a Christian conventual education. The
impressions received in the house of her parents
were so lively, that Christianity found no entrance
into her heart; she remained faithful to Judaism.
Nevertheless, her soul was nourished by fantastic
dreams induced by her surroundings, and her
thoughts took an eccentric direction. She developed
into a lovely girl, and longed to escape from the
cloister. One day she was found by Jews, who had
again settled in the place, in the Jewish cemetery.
Astonished at finding a beautiful girl of sixteen
lightly clad in such a position, they questioned her,
and received answer that she was of Jewish extraction,
and had been brought up in a convent. The
night before, she said, she had been bodily seized
by her father's ghost, and carried out of bed to the
cemetery. In support of her statement, she showed
the women nail-marks on her body, which were
said to come from her father's hands. She appears<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_129" id="Page_129">129</a></span>
to have learnt in the convent the art of producing
scars on her body. The Jews thought it
dangerous to keep a fugitive from the convent in
their midst, and sent her to Amsterdam. There
she found her brother. Eccentric by nature and
excited by the change in her fortunes, she continually
repeated the words, that she was destined to be
the wife of the Messiah, who was soon to appear.
After she had lived some years in Amsterdam under
the name of Sarah, she came&mdash;it is not known for
what purpose&mdash;by way of Frankfort-on-the-Main to
Leghorn. There, as credible witnesses aver, she
put her charms to immoral use, yet continued to
maintain that she was dedicated to the Messiah,
and could contract no other marriage. The strange
history of this Polish girl circulated amongst the
Jews, and penetrated even to Cairo. Sabbata√Ø Zevi,
who heard of it, gave out that a Polish-Jewish maiden
had been promised to him in a dream as his spiritual
wife. He sent a messenger to Leghorn, and
had Sarah brought to Cairo.</p>

<p>By her fantastical, free, self-confident behavior
and by her beauty, Sarah made a peculiar impression
upon Sabbata√Ø and his companions. He himself
was firmly convinced of his Messiahship. To
Sabbata√Ø and his friends the immoral life of this
Polish adventuress was not unknown. This also
was said to be a Messianic dispensation; he had
been directed, like the prophet Hosea, to marry an
unchaste wife. No one was so happy as Raphael
Joseph Chelebi, because at his house the Messiah
met his bride, and was married. He placed his
wealth at the disposal of Sabbata√Ø Zevi, and became
his most influential follower. The warm adhesion
of so dignified, respected, and powerful a man
brought many believers to Sabbata√Ø. It was rightly
said, that he had come to Egypt as a messenger,
and returned as the Messiah. For, from this second
residence at Cairo dates his public career. Sarah,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_130" id="Page_130">130</a></span>
also, the Messiah's fair bride, brought him many disciples.
Through her a romantic, licentious element
entered into the fantastic career of the Smyrna
Messiah. Her beauty and free manner of life attracted
youths and men who had no sympathy with
the mystical movement. With a larger following
than when he started, Sabbata√Ø returned to Palestine,
bringing two talismans of more effective power
than Kabbalistic means&mdash;Sarah's influence and
Chelebi's money. At Gaza he found a third confederate,
who helped to smooth his path.</p>

<p>At Jerusalem there lived a man named Elisha
Levi, who had migrated thither from Germany. The
Jews of the Holy City dispatched him to all parts
of the world with begging letters. Whilst he was
roaming through northern Africa, Amsterdam, Hamburg,
and Poland, his son Nathan Benjamin Levi
(1644&ndash;1680) was left to himself, or the perverse education
of that time. He developed, in the school
of Jacob Chages, into a youth with superficial knowledge
of the Talmud, acquired Kabbalistic scraps,
and obtained facility in the high-sounding, but hollow,
nonsensical Rabbinical style of the period,
which concealed poverty of thought beneath verbiage.
The pen was his faithful instrument, and
replaced the gift of speech, in which he had little
facility. This youth was suddenly raised from pressing
poverty to opulence. A rich Portuguese, Samuel
Lisbona, who had moved from Damascus to
Gaza, asked Jacob Chages to recommend a husband
for his beautiful, but one-eyed daughter, and he
suggested his disciple Nathan Benjamin. Thus he
became connected with a rich house, and in consequence
of his change of fortune, lost all stability, if
he had had any. When Sabbata√Ø Zevi, with a large
train of followers, came to Gaza on his way back
from Cairo, posing as the Messiah, and accepted as
such by the crowds gathering about him, Nathan
Ghazati (<i>i.e.</i>, of Gaza) entered into close relationship<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_131" id="Page_131">131</a></span>
with him. In what way their mutual acquaintance
and attachment arose is not explained. Sabbata√Ø's
disciples declared that Nathan had dug up a part
of the ancient writing, wherein Zevi's Messiahship
was testified. It is probably nearer the truth, that
Sabbata√Ø, to convince Ghazati of his mission, palmed
off on him the spurious document received from
Abraham Yachini. At any rate Nathan became his
most zealous adherent, whether from conviction or
from a desire to play a prominent part, can no
longer be discerned in this story, in which simple
faith, self-deception, and willful imposture, border
so close on one another.</p>

<p>After Nathan Ghazati and Sabbata√Ø had become
acquainted, the former a youth of twenty, the latter
a man of forty, prophetic revelations followed close
upon one another. Ghazati professed to be the
risen Elijah, who was to pave the way for the
Messiah. He gave out that he had received a
call on a certain day (probably the eve of the Pentecost,
1665), that in a year and a few months the
Messiah would show himself in his glory, would
take the sultan captive without arms, only with
music, and establish the dominion of Israel over all
the nations of the earth. The Messianic age was to
begin in the year 1666. This revelation was proclaimed
everywhere in writing by the pretended
prophet of Gaza, with the addition of wild fantasies
and suggestive details. He wrote to Raphael
Joseph acknowledging the receipt of the moneys
sent by him, and begging him not to lose faith in
Sabbata√Ø; the latter would certainly in a year and
some months make the sultan his subject and lead
him about as a captive. The dominion would be
entrusted to Nathan, until he should conquer the
other nations without bloodshed, warring only
against Germany, the enemy of the Jews. Then
the Messiah would betake himself to the banks of
the river Sabbation, and there espouse the daughter<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_132" id="Page_132">132</a></span>
of the great prophet, Moses, who at the age of thirteen
would be exalted as queen, with Sarah as her
slave. Finally, he would lead back the ten tribes to
the Holy Land, riding upon a lion with a seven-headed
dragon in its jaws. The more exaggerated
and absurd Nathan's prophetic vaporings were, the
more credence did they find. A veritable fit of intoxication
took possession of nearly all the Jews of
Jerusalem and the neighboring communities. With
a prophet, formerly a shy youth, proclaiming so
great a message, and a Messiah, more profoundly
versed in the Kabbala than Chayim Vital, who could
venture to doubt the approach of the time of grace?
Those who shook their heads at this rising imposture
were laughed to scorn by the Sabbatians.</p>

<p>The rabbinical leaders of the Jerusalem community
were unfavorably struck by this Messianic
movement, and sought to stifle it at its birth. It
was sufficient to prejudice them against Sabbata√Ø
that he stood in the foreground, and put them in the
shade. He is said to have distributed the money
from Egypt according to his own discretion, and in
the division to have unduly favored his own followers.
Jacob Chages and his college threatened him
with the heaviest excommunication if he should persist
in his course. Sabbata√Ø Zevi appears to have
cared little for this, especially as a ban could have
no effect if the community was on his side. Even
Moses Galante, the son-in-law of Jacob Chages, esteemed
as an authority in the Holy Land, regarded
him with respect, although, as he afterwards declared,
he did not believe in him unconditionally.
Sabbata√Ø Zevi saw clearly that Jerusalem was not
the right place for his plans, as the rabbis would
place obstacles in his way. Nathan Ghazati thereupon
proclaimed in an ecstasy that Jerusalem had
lost its importance as the sacred city, and that Gaza
had taken its place. At Smyrna, his native city&mdash;an
important gathering-place for Europeans and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_133" id="Page_133">133</a></span>
Asiatics&mdash;Sabbata√Ø thought he could obtain greater
success. His rich brothers prepared a good reception
for him by the distribution of money amongst
the poor and needy, and Nathan's extravagant prophetic
letters had kindled the imagination of the
people. But before he left Jerusalem, Sabbata√Ø took
care to dispatch active missionaries of a fanatical
and fraudulent character, to predict his Messianic
appearance, excite men's minds, and fill them with
his name. Sabbata√Ø Raphael, a beggar and impostor
from the Morea, enlarged in mountebank
fashion on the Messiah's greatness; and a German
Kabbalist, Matathias Bloch, did the same in blind
simplicity.</p>

<p>Thus it came to pass that when Sabbata√Ø Zevi left
Jerusalem&mdash;of his own accord, as he pretended,
banished, as others said&mdash;he was at once received
in triumph in the large Asiatic community of Aleppo.
Still greater was the homage paid him in his native
city (autumn 1665). The ban pronounced against
him was not remembered. He was accompanied
by a man of Jerusalem, Samuel Primo, who became
his private secretary, and one of his most zealous
recruiting agents. Samuel Primo understood the
art of investing trifles with an air of official seriousness
and by a flowery style to give world-wide
importance to the Messianic imposture. He
alone remained sober in the midst of the ever-increasing
fanaticism, and gave aim and direction to
the enthusiasts. Primo appears to have heralded
Sabbata√Ø's fame from conviction; he had a secret
plan to be accomplished through the Messiah. He
appears to have made use of Sabbata√Ø more than to
have been employed by him. Sabbata√Ø had tact
enough not to announce himself at once at Smyrna
as the Messiah; he commanded the believing multitude
not to speak of it until the proper time. But
this reserve, combined with other circumstances&mdash;the
ranting letters of Nathan, the arrival of some<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_134" id="Page_134">134</a></span>
men of Jerusalem who brought him the homage of
the Holy City (though without being commissioned
to do so), the severe mortifications which the people
inflicted on themselves, to atone for their sins and
become worthy of the coming of the Messiah&mdash;all
this worked upon the minds of the multitude, and
they could scarcely wait for the day of his revelation.
He had the Kabbalists on his side through his mystical
utterances. At length Sabbata√Ø Zevi declared
himself publicly in the synagogue, with blowing of
horns, as the expected Messiah (New Year, September,
or October, 1665), and the multitude shouted
to him, "Long live our King, our Messiah!"</p>

<p>The proverb that a prophet is least honored in
his own country was for once belied. The madness
of the Jews of Smyrna knew no bounds. Every
sign of honor and enthusiastic love was shown him.
It was not joy, but delirium to feel that the long-expected
Messiah had at last appeared, and in their
own community. The delirium seized great and
small. Women, girls, and children fell into raptures,
and proclaimed Sabbata√Ø Zevi in the language
of the Zohar as the true redeemer. The word of
the prophet, that God at the end of the world will
pour forth his spirit upon the young, appeared fulfilled.
All prepared for a speedy exodus, the return
to the Holy Land. Workmen neglected their
business, and thought only of the approaching kingdom
of the Messiah. The confusion in men's brains
showed itself in the way in which the Sabbatians of
Smyrna strove to merit a share in the time of grace.
On the one hand, they subjected themselves to incredible
penances&mdash;fasted several days in succession,
refrained from sleep for nights, in order that,
by Kabbalistic prayers (Tikkunim) at midnight, they
might wipe away their sins, and bathed in extremely
cold weather, even with snow on the ground. Some
buried themselves up to the neck in the soil, and
remained in their damp graves until their limbs were<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_135" id="Page_135">135</a></span>
stiff with cold. On the other hand, they abandoned
themselves to the most extravagant delight, and
celebrated festival after festival in honor of the Messiah,
whenever Sabbata√Ø Zevi showed himself&mdash;always
with a large train of followers&mdash;or walked
through the streets singing Psalms, "The right hand
of the Lord is exalted, the right hand of the Lord
bringeth victory," or preached in a synagogue, and
proved his Messiahship by Kabbalistic interpretations
of Scripture. He showed himself only in procession
in public, waved a fan to cool himself, and
whoever was touched with it was sure of the kingdom
of heaven. The delirious joy of his followers
knew no bounds. Every word of his was repeated
a thousand times as the word of God, expounded,
exaggerated, and intensified. All that he did was
held as miraculous, published, and believed. The
madness went so far that his adherents in Smyrna
and elsewhere, as at Salonica, that Kabbalist hot-bed
of old, married their children of twelve, ten, and
even younger, to one another&mdash;seven hundred
couples in all&mdash;that, according to Kabbalistic ideas,
they might cause the souls not yet born to enter
into life, and thereby remove the last obstacle to the
commencement of the time of grace.</p>

<p>The activity of Sabbata√Ø Zevi in electrifying the
minds of simple believers, now by public pomp and
pageantry, now by silent retirement, was supplemented
by Sarah, his wife, who by her loose conduct
worked on the passions of the male population.
The bonds of chastity, drawn much tighter among
Eastern Jews than in Europe, were broken. The
assembling of persons of both sexes in great multitudes,
hitherto unheard of, was a slight innovation.
In Messianic transports of delight men and women
danced with one another as if mad, and in mystical
fervor many excesses are said to have been committed.
The voice of censure and caution was
gradually silenced; all were drawn into the vortex,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_136" id="Page_136">136</a></span>
and the unbelievers were rendered harmless. The
rabbi Aaron de la Papa (died 1674), an aged and
respectable man, who at first spoke against this
Messianic madness, and pronounced the ban against
its originator, together with other rabbis, was publicly
reviled in a sermon by Sabbata√Ø, removed from
office, and obliged to leave Smyrna.</p>

<p>Most unworthy was the behavior of the rabbi
Chayim Benvenisti (1603&ndash;1673), a very considerable
authority on the Talmud, and of astonishing learning,
who, because he was a literary opponent of De
la Papa, not only suffered the latter's removal from
office, but allowed himself to be appointed in his
place by Sabbata√Ø. Though at first harshly disposed
towards the new Messiah, he became a
believer, and led the multitude by his authority.
The latter were instigated by Sabbata√Ø to bloodthirsty
fanaticism. Because a noble, rich, and respected
man in Smyrna, Chayim Penya, who had
liberally supported Chayim Benvenisti, opposed
the widespread delusion with obstinate incredulity,
he was suddenly attacked in the synagogue, persecuted,
and nearly torn to pieces by the raging
multitude. Sabbata√Ø Zevi, the pretended incarnation
of piety, commanded the synagogue to be
broken open and the vile heretic to be seized. But
when Penya's daughters, likewise attacked by the
madness, fell into raptures, and prophesied, the
father had no choice but to put a good face upon
the wretched business. He also assumed the air of
a zealous adherent. After Penya's subjugation Sabbata√Ø
Zevi became sole ruler in the community, and
could lead the Jewish population at will for good
or for evil. In this humor which lasted for some
months, the Jews of Smyrna feared their tyrants,
the Turkish cadis, very little; if they offered to
check the prevailing tendency, they were induced by
rich presents to remain inactive.</p>

<p>These events in the Jews' quarter at Smyrna<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_137" id="Page_137">137</a></span>
made a great sensation in ever-widening circles.
The neighboring communities of Asia Minor, many
members of which had betaken themselves to
Smyrna, and witnessing the scenes enacted in that
town, brought home exaggerated accounts of the
Messiah's power of attraction and of working miracles,
were swept into the same vortex. Sabbata√Ø's
private secretary, Samuel Primo, took care that
reports of the fame and doings of the Messiah should
reach Jews abroad. Nathan Ghazati sent circulars
from Palestine, while the itinerant prophets, Sabbata√Ø
Raphael and Matathias Bloch, filled the ears
of their auditors with the most marvelous accounts
of the new redeemer. Christians also helped to
spread the story. The residents, the clerks of
English and Dutch mercantile houses, and the evangelical
ministers, reported the extraordinary occurrences
in Smyrna, and though they scoffed at the
folly of the Jews, could not withhold half-credulous
sympathy. Did they not see with their own eyes
the ecstasies, and hear with their own ears the predictions,
of the prophets and prophetesses of Sabbata√Ø
Zevi, the true redeemer? On the exchanges
in Europe men spoke of him as a remarkable personage,
and eagerly awaited news from Smyrna or Constantinople.
At first the Jews were dazed by the
reports that suddenly burst upon them. Was the
long cherished hope, that one day the oppression
and shame of Israel would be removed, and that he
would return in glory to his home, at length to be
realized? No wonder that nearly everywhere
scenes similar to those in Smyrna were repeating
themselves, that men's minds were filled with credulity,
accepting mere rumors as accredited facts,
or that wild excitement, ascetic living, and almsgiving
to the needy, by way of preparation for the time
of the Messiah, were followed here and there by
prophetic ecstasies. Not only the senseless multitude,
but nearly all the rabbis, and even men of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_138" id="Page_138">138</a></span>
culture and philosophical judgment, fell a prey to
this credulity.</p>

<p>At that time not a single man of weight and
importance recognized that the primary source of all
these phenomena lay in the Kabbala and the Zohar.
Jacob Sasportas, originally from Africa, had lived in
Amsterdam and London and, at this time, was in
Hamburg. He was born about 1620, and died 1698.
A man of courage and keen penetration, whose
word had weight through his Talmudical learning,
Sasportas from the first combated this Messianic
rage with passionate warmth. He was unwearied
in sending letter after letter to the various
communities and their guides in Europe, Asia, and
Africa, to unmask the gross deceptions practiced,
and to warn against the sad consequences. But even
he was entangled in the snares of the Kabbala, and
adopted its principles. On the ground of this
spurious philosophy, thoroughgoing enthusiasts
were more in the right than half-hearted adherents.
Spinoza, who might have scattered this thick mist
with his luminous ideas, was not only estranged
from Judaism and his race, but even hostile to them,
and regarded the prevailing perplexities with indifference
or malice.</p>

<p>The accounts of Sabbata√Ø Zevi and the Messianic
excitement either came direct, or in a roundabout
way by Alexandria, to Venice, Leghorn, and other
Italian cities.</p>

<p>Venice was led by the bigoted Kabbalist Moses
Zacut, Spinoza's very uncongenial fellow-student,
who had formed the design of migrating from Amsterdam
through Poland to Palestine, but stopped
short in Venice. Far from opposing the delusion
of the multitude, he encouraged it, as did the rabbinate
of Venice. The news from Smyrna had most
striking effect upon the great and the lesser Jerusalem
of the North. The prophet of Gaza, who was
not devoid of sober calculation, had directed his<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_139" id="Page_139">139</a></span>
propagandist circulars to the most considerable and
the richest communities&mdash;Amsterdam and Hamburg.
These entered into close relationship with the new
Messianic movement. The Jews of Amsterdam and
Hamburg received confirmation of the extraordinary
events at Smyrna from trustworthy Christians, many
of whom were sincerely rejoiced thereat. Even
Heinrich Oldenburg, a distinguished German savant
in London, wrote to his friend Spinoza (December,
1665):&mdash;</p>

<blockquote>

<p>"All the world here is talking of a rumor of the return of the Israelites,
dispersed for more than two thousand years, to their own country.
Few believe it, but many wish it.... Should the news be confirmed,
it may bring about a revolution in all things."</p></blockquote>

<p>The number of believers in Amsterdam increased
daily among the Portuguese no less than among the
Germans, and numbers of educated people set the
example; the rabbis Isaac Aboab and Raphael
Moses D'Aguilar, Spinoza's fellow-student Isaac
Naar, and Abraham Pereira, one of the capitalists
of Amsterdam and a writer on morals in Spanish,
all became believers. Even the semi-Spinozist
Dionysius Musaphia became a zealous adherent of
the new Messiah. In Amsterdam devotion to the
new faith expressed itself in contradictory ways&mdash;by
noisy music and dancing in the houses of prayer,
and by gloomy, monkish self-mortification. The
printing presses could not supply enough copies of
special prayer-books in Hebrew, Portuguese and
Spanish, for the multitude of believers. In these
books penances and formulas were given by which
men hoped to become partakers in the kingdom of
the Messiah. Many Sabbatian prayer-books (Tikkunim)
printed Sabbata√Ø's likeness together with
that of King David, also the emblems of his dominion,
and select sentences from the Bible. In confident
expectation of speedy return to the Holy
Land, the elders of one synagogue introduced the
custom of pronouncing the priestly blessing every
Sabbath.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_140" id="Page_140">140</a></span>
At Hamburg, the Jews went to still greater
lengths of folly, because they wished to make a
demonstration against the bigoted Christians, who
in many ways tormented them with vexatious restrictions,
and when possible compelled them to listen
to Christian sermons. Whoever entered the
synagogue, and saw the Jewish worshipers hop,
jump, and dance about with the roll of the Law in
their arms, serious, respectable men withal, of Spanish
stateliness, had to take them for madmen. In
fact, a mental disease prevailed, which made men
childish; even the most distinguished in the community
succumbed to it.</p>

<p>Manoel Texeira, also called Isaac Se√±or Texeira,
was born about 1630, and died about 1695. Some
months before the death of his father, Diego Texeira,
a Marrano nobleman who had emigrated from Portugal
and settled at Hamburg, Manoel became resident
minister, banker, and confidant of Christina,
former queen of Sweden. She valued him on account
of his honesty, his noble bearing, and his
shrewdness. She exchanged letters with him on
important affairs, conferred with him on the political
interests of Europe, and credited him with deep,
statesmanlike views. During her residence at
Hamburg she took up her abode in Manoel Texeira's
house, to the vexation of the local ecclesiastical
authorities&mdash;who were hostile to the Jews&mdash;and
remained quite unconcerned, although the Protestant
preachers censured her severely from the
pulpits. Men of the highest rank resorted to Texeira's
house, and played with him for high stakes.
This Jewish cavalier also belonged to Sabbata√Ø's adherents,
and joined in the absurd dances; as also
the skillful and famous physician Bendito de Castro
(Baruch Nehemiah), now advanced in years, for a
time the physician of the queen during her residence
in Hamburg. De Castro was at that time director
of the Hamburg community, and by his order the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_141" id="Page_141">141</a></span>
Messianic follies were practiced in the synagogue.
Jacob Sasportas, who because of the outbreak of the
plague in London at that time resided in Hamburg,
used serious arguments and satire against this Messianic
delusion; but he could not make his voice
heard, and only just escaped rough handling by the
Sabbatians. The community recently established
in London in the reign of Charles II, which had
elected Jacob Sasportas as chief rabbi, was no less
possessed with this craze. It derived additional
encouragement from contact with Christian enthusiasts
who hoped to bring about the millennium.
Curious reports flew from mouth to mouth. It was
said, that in the north of Scotland a ship had appeared,
with silken sails and ropes, manned by sailors
who spoke Hebrew. The flag bore the inscription,
"The Twelve Tribes or Families of Israel."
Believers living in London in English fashion offered
wagers at the odds of ten to one that Sabbata√Ø
would be anointed king at Jerusalem within two
years, and drew formal bills of exchange upon the
issue. Wherever Jews dwelt, news of the Kabbalistic
Messiah of Smyrna penetrated, and everywhere
produced wild excitement. The little community
of Avignon, which was not treated in the mildest
manner by the papal officers, prepared to emigrate
to the kingdom of Judah in the spring of the year
1666.</p>

<p>If Sabbata√Ø Zevi had not hitherto firmly believed
in himself and his dignity, this homage from nearly
the whole Jewish race must have awakened conviction.
Every day advices, messengers, and deputations
came pouring in, greeting him in most flattering
terms as king of the Jews, placing life and
property at his disposal, and overwhelming him
with gifts. Had he been a man of resolute determination
and strength of will, he might have obtained
results of importance with this genuine enthusiasm
and willing devotion of his believers. Even<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_142" id="Page_142">142</a></span>
Spinoza entertained the possibility, with this favorable
opportunity and the mutability of human things,
that the Jews might re-establish their kingdom,
and again be the chosen of God. But Sabbata√Ø
Zevi was satisfied with the savor of incense. He
cherished no great design, or rather, he lived in the
delusion that men's expectations would fulfill themselves
of their own accord by a miracle. Samuel
Primo and some of his confidants appear, however,
to have followed a fixed plan, namely, to modify the
Rabbinical system, or even to abolish it. That was
in reality implied in the reign of the Messiah. The
fundamental conception of the Zohar, the Bible of the
Kabbalists, is that in the time of grace, in the world
of order (Olam ha-Tikkun), the laws of Judaism, the
regulations concerning lawful and forbidden things,
would completely lose their significance. Now this
time, the Sabbatians thought, had already begun;
consequently, the minute ritualistic code of the
Shulchan Aruch ought no longer to be held binding.
Whether Sabbata√Ø himself drew this conclusion, is
doubtful. But some of his trusted adherents gave
this theory prominence. A certain bitterness
towards the Talmud and the Talmudic method of
teaching prevailed in this circle. The Sabbatian
mystics felt themselves confined by the close meshes
of the Rabbinical network, and sought to disentangle
it loop by loop. They set up a new deity, substituting
a man-god for the God of Israel. In their
wanton extravagance the Kabbalists had so entirely
changed the conception of the deity, that it had
dwindled away into nothing. On the other hand,
they had so exalted and magnified the Messiah, that
he was close to God. The Sabbatians, or one of
them (Samuel Primo?), built on this foundation.
From the Divine bosom (the Ancient of Days),
they said, a new divine personage had sprung,
capable of restoring the order in the world intended
in the original plan of Divine Perfection. This new<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_143" id="Page_143">143</a></span>
person was the Holy King (Malka Kadisha), the
Messiah, the Primal Man (Adam Kadmon), who
would destroy evil, sin, and corruption, and cause
the dried-up streams of grace to flow again. He,
the holy king, the Messiah, is the true God, the redeemer
and saviour of the world, the God of Israel;
to him alone should prayers be addressed. The
Holy King, or Messiah, combines two natures&mdash;one
male, the other female; he can do more on account
of his higher wisdom than the Creator of the world.
Samuel Primo, who dispatched circulars and ordinances
in the name of the Messianic king, often
used the signature, "I, the Lord, your God, Sabbata√Ø
Zevi." Whether the Smyrna fanatic authorized such
blasphemous presumptuousness cannot be decided,
any more than whether in his heart he considered
the Jewish law null and void. For, although some
Sabbatians, who uttered these absurdities, pretended
to have heard them from his own lips, other disciples
asserted that he was an adherent of traditional Judaism.</p>

<p>The truth probably is that Sabbata√Ø Zevi, absorbed
in idle ruminating, accepted everything which
the more energetic among his followers taught or
suggested. They began the dissolution of Judaism
by the transformation of the fast of the tenth of
Tebeth (Asara be-Tebeth) into a day of rejoicing.
Samuel Primo, in the name of his divinity, directed
a circular to the whole of Israel in semi-official form:</p>

<blockquote>

<p>"The first-begotten Son of God, Sabbata√Ø Zevi, Messiah and Redeemer
of the people of Israel, to all the sons of Israel, Peace! Since
ye have been deemed worthy to behold the great day and the fulfillment
of God's word by the prophets, your lament and sorrow must
be changed into joy, and your fasting into merriment, for ye shall
weep no more. Rejoice with song and melody, and change the day
formerly spent in sadness and sorrow, into a day of jubilee, because
I have appeared."</p></blockquote>

<p>So firmly rooted in men's minds was faith in Sabbata√Ø
Zevi, that the communities which the letter
reached in time discontinued this fast, although<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_144" id="Page_144">144</a></span>
they believed that they could enter into the kingdom
of the Messiah only by strict abstinence. The staunch
orthodox party, however, was shocked at this innovation.
They could not conceive the Messiah as other
than a pious rabbi, who, if possible, would invent
fresh burdens. A thousand times had they read in
the Zohar, and repeated to one another, that in the
time of the Messiah the days of mourning would be
changed into days of feasting, and the Law in general
would be no longer binding; but when words
were changed into deeds, horror seized them.
Those rabbis who before had regarded the movement
half incredulously, or had not interfered with the
penances and deeds of active benevolence to which
many of the Sabbatians had felt prompted, thereby
giving silent assent, now raised their voice against
the law-destroying Messiahship. There began to
be formed in every large community a small party
of unbelievers (Kofrim), chiefly men learned in the
Talmud, who desired to guard the established religion
against attacks and disruption.</p>

<p>Rabbinical Judaism and the Kabbala, hitherto in
close confederation, began to be at variance with
each other; this doubtful ally showing herself at
last in her true form as the enemy of Rabbinism.
But this sobering discovery, that the Kabbala was
a serpent nursed into life by the rabbis themselves,
was recognized only by a few. They still remained true
to her, imputing the growing hostility to the Shulchan
Aruch to Sabbata√Ø and his aiders and abettors.
It was too late, their voices were drowned in shouts
of joy. Solomon Algazi, and some members of the
Smyrna rabbinate who shared his opinions, tried to
oppose the abolition of the fast, but were nearly
stoned to death by the multitude of believers, and
were obliged, like Aaron de la Papa, to leave the
city in haste.</p>

<p>But the Messiah was at last forced to tear himself
out of his fool's paradise and the atmosphere<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_145" id="Page_145">145</a></span>
of incense in Smyrna, in order to accomplish his
work in the Turkish capital&mdash;either because his followers
compelled him to put his light, not under a
bushel, but upon it, that the world at large might
see it, or because the cadi could no longer endure
the mad behavior of the Jews, and did not wish to
bear the sole responsibility. It is said that the cadi
gave Sabbata√Ø Zevi three days to go to Constantinople
and appear before the highest Turkish authorities.
In his delusion, Zevi perhaps believed that
a miracle would fulfill the prophecies of Nathan
Ghazati and other prophets, that he would easily be
able to take the crown from the sultan. He prepared
for his journey. Before he left Smyrna, he
divided the world among his six-and-twenty faithful
ones, and called them kings and princes. His
brothers, Elijah and Joseph Zevi, received the lion's
share; the former was named king of kings, the
latter king of the kings of Judah. To his other
faithful followers he disclosed, in Kabbalistic language,
which soul of the former kings of Judah or
Israel dwelt in each of their bodies, that is, had
passed into them by transmigration. Among the
better known names were those of the companion
of his youth, Isaac Silveira, and Abraham Yachini at
Constantinople, who had imparted to him the art of
mysticism. Raphael Joseph Chelebi could least of
all be passed over; he had been the first firm supporter
of the Messiah, and was called King Joash.
A Marrano physician, who had escaped from Portugal,
and was his devoted adherent, received the
crown of Portugal. Even his former opponent
Chayim Penya received a kingdom of his own. A
beggar, Abraham Rubio of Smyrna, was likewise
raised to a throne, under the name of Josiah, and was
so firmly convinced of his approaching sovereignty
that he refused large sums for his imaginary kingdom.</p>

<p>Sabbata√Ø Zevi appears purposely to have started
on his Messianic journey to Constantinople exactly<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_146" id="Page_146">146</a></span>
at the beginning of the mystic year 1666. He was
accompanied by some of his followers, his secretary
Samuel Primo being in his train. He had announced
the day of his arrival at Constantinople,
but circumstances proved false to him. The ship
in which he sailed had to contend with bad weather,
and the voyage was prolonged by weeks. Since
the sea did not devour him, the Sabbatians composed
marvelous stories describing how the storm
and the waves had obeyed the Messiah. At
some place on the coast of the Dardanelles the passengers
of the weather-beaten vessel were obliged
to land, and there Sabbata√Ø was arrested by Turkish
officers, sent to take him prisoner. The grand
vizir, Ahmed Coprili, had heard of the excitement
of the Jews in Smyrna, and desired to suppress it.
The officers had strict orders to bring the pretended
redeemer in fetters to the capital, and therefore
hastened to meet the ship by which he came. According
to orders, they put him in fetters, and
brought him to a small town in the neighborhood of
Constantinople, because the eve of the Sabbath was
near. Informed by a messenger of his arrival at
Cheknese Kutschuk, his followers hastened from
the capital to see him, but found him in a pitiable
plight and in chains. The money which they
brought with them procured him some alleviation,
and on the following Sunday (February, 1666), he
was brought by sea to Constantinople&mdash;but in how
different a manner to what he and his believers had
anticipated! However, his coming caused excitement.
At the landing-place there was such a crowd
of Jews and Turks who desired to see the Messiah,
that the police were obliged to superintend the disembarkation.
An under-pasha commissioned to
receive him welcomed the man-god with a vigorous
box on the ear. Sabbata√Ø Zevi is said, however, to
have wisely turned the other cheek to the blow.
Since he could not play the part of the triumphant,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_147" id="Page_147">147</a></span>
he at least wished to play that of the suffering Messiah
with good grace. When brought before the
deputy-vizir (Kaimakam), Mustapha Pasha, he did
not stand the first test brilliantly. Asked what his
intentions were, and why he had roused the Jews to
such a pitch of excitement, Sabbata√Ø is said to have
answered that he was nothing more than a Jewish
Chacham, come from Jerusalem to the capital to collect
alms; he could not help it if the Jews testified
so much devotion to him. Mustapha thereupon
sent him to a prison in which insolvent Jewish debtors
were confined.</p>

<p>Far from being disappointed at this treatment,
his followers in Constantinople persisted in their
delusion. For some days they kept quietly at home,
because the street boys mocked them by shouting,
"Is he coming? is he coming?" (Gheldi mi, Gheldi
mi.) But they soon began again to assert that he
was the true Messiah, and that the sufferings which
he had encountered were necessary, a condition to
his glorification. The prophets continued to proclaim
the speedy redemption of Sabbata√Ø and of all
Israel. A Turkish dervish filled the streets of Constantinople
with prophecies of the Messiah, whose
enemies said that Sabbata√Ø's followers had bribed
him. Thousands crowded daily to Sabbata√Ø's place
of confinement merely to catch a glimpse of him.
English merchants whose claims were not satisfied
by their Jewish debtors applied to the Messiah.
An order in his handwriting, admonishing defaulters
to do justice to their creditors, as otherwise they
would have no share in his joy and glory, had the
best effect. Samuel Primo took care that most fabulous
accounts should reach the Jews of Smyrna
and those at a distance, of the reverence paid the
Messiah by the Turkish authorities. At heart, he
wrote, they were all convinced of his dignity. The
expectations of the Jews were raised to a still higher
pitch, and the most exaggerated hopes fostered to<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_148" id="Page_148">148</a></span>
a greater degree. It was looked upon as a palpable
miracle that summary Turkish justice allowed him,
the rebellious Jew, to live. Did not this act of
mercy prove that he was feared? The Turkish
government in fact seems to have stood in awe of
the Jewish Messiah. The Cretan war was impending,
which demanded all the energy of the half-exhausted
Turkish empire. The prudent grand
vizir, Ahmed Coprili, did not like to sentence him
to death, thus making a fresh martyr, and causing
a desperate riot among the Jews. Even the Turks,
charmed by Sabbata√Ø's manner, and deceived by extraordinary
miraculous manifestations, especially by
the prophecies of women and children, joined the
ranks of his worshipers. It seemed to Coprili
equally dangerous to leave Sabbata√Ø, during his absence
at the war, in Constantinople, where he might
easily add fuel to the ever-increasing excitement in
the capital. He therefore commanded, after Sabbata√Ø
had been imprisoned in Constantinople for
two months&mdash;from the beginning of February to
April 17&mdash;that he be taken to the castle of the
Dardanelles at Abydos, where state-prisoners were
wont to be kept in custody. It was a mild confinement;
some of his friends, among them Samuel
Primo, were allowed to accompany him thither.
The Sabbatians called this fortress by a mystical
name, the Tower of Strength (Migdal Oz).</p>

<p>If Sabbata√Ø Zevi had doubted himself for a moment,
his courage rose through his change of abode,
the respectful clemency shown him by the divan,
and the steady and increasing devotion of the Jews.
He felt himself the Messiah again. On his arrival
at the castle of the Dardanelles on April 19, the day
of preparation for the Passover, he slew a Paschal
lamb for himself and his followers, and ate it with
the fat, which is forbidden by the laws of the Talmud.
He is said, while doing so, to have used a blessing
which implied that the Mosaic, Talmudic, and Rabbinical<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_149" id="Page_149">149</a></span>
law was abrogated&mdash;"Blessed be God, who
hath restored again that which was forbidden." At
Abydos he held regular court with the large sums
of money which his brothers and his rich adherents
sent him with lavish hand. His wife Sarah, who
was allowed to remain with him, demeaned herself
as the Messianic queen, and bewitched the multitude
by her charms. From the Turkish capital a number
of ships conveyed his followers to the castle of the
Dardanelles. The fare on vessels rose in consequence
daily. From other countries and continents,
too, crowds of Jews streamed to the place of his
captivity, in the hope to be deemed worthy of beholding
him. The governor of the castle reaped
advantage thereby, for he charged the visitors entrance
money, and raised it to fifteen or thirty marks
a head. Even the inhabitants of the place profited,
because they could earn high prices for board and
lodging. A veritable shower of gold poured into
Abydos. The impression which these facts, industriously
circulated and exaggerated, made on the
Jews in Europe, Asia, and Africa, and the effect
which they produced, are indescribable. With few
exceptions all were convinced of Sabbata√Ø's Messiahship,
and of a speedy redemption, in two years
at the latest. They argued that he had had the
courage to go to the Turkish capital, although he
had openly proclaimed the dethronement of the
sultan, yet had not forfeited his life, but had been
left in a sort of mock imprisonment. What more
was needed to confirm the predictions of prophets
of ancient and modern times? The Jews accordingly
prepared seriously to return to their original
home. In Hungary they began to unroof their
houses. In large commercial cities, where Jews
took the lead in wholesale business, such as Amsterdam,
Leghorn, and Hamburg, stagnation of
trade ensued. In almost all synagogues his initials,
S and Z, were posted up with more or less adornment.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_150" id="Page_150">150</a></span>
Almost everywhere a prayer for him was
inserted in the following form: "Bless our Lord
and King, the holy and righteous Sabbata√Ø Zevi, the
Messiah of the God of Jacob." In Europe the eyes
of all communities were directed to Amsterdam, the
representatives of which adhered to the movement
most enthusiastically. Every post-day which brought
fresh letters was a holiday for them. The Amsterdam
Jews showed their joy openly, and were afraid
neither of the Christian population nor of the magistrates.
Isaac Naar, of Amsterdam, and the rich
Abraham Pereira, prepared themselves for a journey
to the Messiah, and the former ironically announced
it to the unbelieving Jacob Sasportas. The Hamburg
community always imitated that of Amsterdam,
or went beyond it. The council introduced
the custom of praying for Sabbata√Ø Zevi, not only
on Saturday, but also on Monday and Thursday.
The unbelievers were compelled to remain in the
synagogue and join in the prayer with a loud Amen.
And all this was done at the suggestion of the educated
physician Bendito de Castro. The believers
went so far as to threaten their opponents if they
ventured to utter a word of censure against Sabbata√Ø.
At Venice, on the Sabbath, a quarrel broke
out between the Sabbatians and their opponents,
and one of the latter nearly lost his life. When
Sabbata√Ø was asked how the Kofrim (unbelievers)
should be dealt with, he, or Samuel Primo, answered
that they might be put to death without ado, even
on the Sabbath; the executors of such punishment
were sure to enjoy eternal bliss. A learned Talmudist
at Buda, Jacob Ashkenazi of Wilna, whose
son and grandson became zealous persecutors of
the Sabbatians, was guided by the decision, and declared
a member of the community worthy of death,
because he would not say the blessing for Sabbata√Ø
Zevi. In Moravia (at Nikolsburg) there were such
violent dissensions and tumults in consequence of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_151" id="Page_151">151</a></span>
the craze about the Messiah, that the governor of
the province was obliged to post up notices to calm
men's minds. At Salee, in the north-western part
of Africa, the ruling Emir Gailan (Gailand) ordered
a persecution of the Jews, because they too openly
displayed the hope of their coming redemption.</p>

<p>Many Christians shared the delusive faith in the
new Messiah, and the weekly tidings from the East
concerning Sabbata√Ø Zevi and his doings made an
overwhelming impression on them. At Hamburg,
for example, pious Protestants betook themselves to
the proselytizing preacher Esdras Edzard, and
asked him what was to be done:</p>

<blockquote>

<p>"We have certain accounts, not only from Jews, but also from our
Christian correspondents at Smyrna, Aleppo, Constantinople, and
other places in Turkey, that the new Messiah of the Jews does many
miracles, and the Jews of the whole world flock to him. What will
become of the Christian doctrine and the belief in our Messiah?"</p></blockquote>

<p>The attention bestowed by educated classes of
Christians upon the extraordinary events, which
were published as news of the day, in turn enhanced
the credulity of the Jews. In short, every circumstance
tended to increase the deception. Only
Jacob Sasportas raised his warning voice against
the imposture. He sent letters in all directions,
here to point out the absurdity of current rumors,
there to collect exact information. He failed to
obtain striking evidence of Sabbata√Ø's, or Nathan's,
roguery. Forged letters and documents were the
order of the day; conscientiousness and uprightness
had utterly disappeared. Thus the mist of false belief
grew thicker and thicker, and one was no longer
able to get at the truth.</p>

<p>For three months, from April to July, Sabbata√Ø
had been leading the life of a prince in the castle
of the Dardanelles, intent only upon his own apotheosis.
Either from caprice or at Samuel Primo's suggestion,
he declared the fast of the 17th Tammuz to
be abolished, because on this day he had realized his<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_152" id="Page_152">152</a></span>
Messianic character. Was this a mere freak, or was
it done with the intention of accustoming his adherents
to the abolition of Rabbinical Judaism? At all
events, he appointed the 23d of Tammuz (July 25th),
a Monday, to be kept as a strict Sabbath. More
than four thousand Jews, men and women, who happened
to be at Abydos, celebrated this new Sabbath
with great scrupulousness. Sabbata√Ø, or his secretary,
sent circulars to the communities directing
them to celebrate the next fast, the ninth of Ab, his
birthday, as a festival by a special service, with
Psalms specially chosen, with eating of choice meats,
and the sound of the harp and singing. He is said
to have contemplated the annulling of all the Jewish
festivals, even the Day of Atonement, and the introduction
of others in their stead. But before this
could be done, he was guilty in his pride of an act
of folly which caused the whole fabric to collapse.</p>

<p>Among the many thousand visitors from far and
near, two Poles from Lemberg made a pilgrimage
to him, to confirm their faith and feast on his countenance.
One was Isaiah, son of a highly-esteemed
Rabbinical authority, the aged David Levi (Ture
Zahab), and grandson of the no less celebrated Joel
Serkes; the other, his half-brother, Leb Herz.
From these two Poles Sabbata√Ø heard that in the
distant land from which they came, another prophet,
Nehemiah Cohen, was announcing the approach of
the Messiah's kingdom, but not through Sabbata√Ø.
He gave Isaiah Levi a laconic letter to take to his
father, in which he promised the Jews of Poland
revenge for the massacre by the Cossacks, and
peremptorily ordered Nehemiah to come to him
with all speed. He laid so much stress on Nehemiah's
coming, that he made his followers eager for
his arrival. The two Poles traveled back delighted
to Lemberg, and everywhere told of the splendor
amid which they had seen the Messiah. Nehemiah
was ordered to hasten to Sabbata√Ø, and he was not<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_153" id="Page_153">153</a></span>
deterred by the length of the journey. When he
arrived at Abydos at the beginning of September,
he was immediately admitted to an audience which
lasted several days. The Polish prophet and the
Smyrna Messiah did not laugh in one another's faces,
like two augurs, but carried on a grave discussion.
The subject of their mystical conversation remained
unknown, as may be imagined. It was said to concern
the forerunner of the Messiah&mdash;the Messiah of
Ephraim&mdash;whether or not he had appeared and
perished, as had been predicted. Nehemiah was
not convinced by the long argument, and did not
conceal the fact. On this account, the fanatical
Sabbatians are said to have secretly made signs to
one another to do away with this dangerous Pole.
He fortunately escaped from the castle, betook himself
forthwith to Adrianople, to the Kaimakam Mustapha,
became a Mahometan, and betrayed the fantastic
and treasonable designs which Sabbata√Ø Zevi
cherished, and which, he said, had remained unknown
to the government, only because the overseer of the
castle of Dardanelles had an interest in the concourse
of Jews.</p>

<p>The Kaimakam conveyed the intelligence to the
sultan, Mahomet IV, and the course to be pursued
with regard to Sabbata√Ø was maturely considered,
the mufti Vanni being also admitted to aid the deliberations.
To make short work with the rebellious
schemer appeared impracticable to the council, particularly
as Mahometans also followed him. If he
should fall as a martyr, a new sect might arise, which
would kindle fresh disturbances. Vanni, a proselytizing
priest, proposed that an attempt be made to
bring Sabbata√Ø over to Islam. This advice was
followed, and the sultan's physician (Hakim Bashi),
a Jewish renegade, by name Guidon, was employed
as the medium. A messenger suddenly appeared
at Abydos, drove away the Jews, who were besieging
the Messiah with homage, conveyed him to<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_154" id="Page_154">154</a></span>
Adrianople, and brought him first to the Hakim
Bashi, who, as a former co-religionist, would be able
to convert him the more easily. The physician represented
to him the dreadful punishment that would
inevitably befall him&mdash;he would be bound, and
scourged through the streets with burning torches,
if he did not appease the wrath of the sultan by
adopting Islamism. It is not known whether this
call to apostatize from Judaism cost the conceited
Messiah great mental conflict. He had not much
manly courage, and Judaism, in its existing form, was
perhaps dead for him. So he adopted Guidon's
advice. The following day (Elul 13, September 14,
1666) he was brought before the sultan. He immediately
cast off his Jewish head-dress, in sign of contempt;
a page offered him a white Turkish turban
and a green instead of the black mantle which he
wore, and so his conversion to the Mahometan
religion was accomplished. When his dress was
changed, it is said that several pounds of biscuit
were found in his loose trousers. The sultan was
highly pleased at this termination of the movement,
gave him the name of Mehmed Effendi, and appointed
him his door-keeper&mdash;Capigi Bashi Otorak&mdash;with
a considerable monthly salary; he was to
remain near the sultan. The Messiah's wife, Sarah,
the Polish rabbi's fair daughter of loose behavior,
likewise became a Mahometan, under the name of
Fauma Kadin, and received rich presents from the
sultana. Some of Sabbata√Ø's followers also went
over to Islam. The mufti Vanni instructed them in
the Mahometan religion. Sabbata√Ø is said to have
married a Mahometan slave, in addition to his wife
Sarah, at the command of the mufti. Nehemiah
Cohen, who had brought about this sudden change,
did not remain in Turkey, but returned to Poland,
took off the turban, and lived quietly without breathing
a word of what had happened. He disappeared
as suddenly as he had come forward. The ex-Messiah<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_155" id="Page_155">155</a></span>
impudently wrote, some days after his conversion,
to his brothers at Smyrna: "God has made
me an Ishmaelite; He commanded, and it was done.
The ninth day of my regeneration." Nearly at the
same time the rabbis and presidents of schools at
Amsterdam assembled, and sent a letter of homage
to Sabbata√Ø Zevi, to testify their belief in and
submission to him. The semi-Spinozist Dionysius
(Benjamin) Musaphia, vexed at not being invited,
wrote a separate letter to Sabbata√Ø Zevi, signed by
himself and two members of the school (Elul 24th).
A week later, twenty-four distinguished men of
Amsterdam sent another letter of homage to the
apostate Messiah. At their head was Abraham
Gideon Abudiente. Did these letters reach the
Mahometan Mehmed Effendi? At Hamburg, where
likewise his conversion was not suspected, the blessing
was five times pronounced over the renegade
Sabbata√Ø, on the Day of Atonement (October 9,
1666).</p>

<p>But when the rumor of his apostasy went the
rounds of the communities, and could no longer be
denied, confidence was succeeded by a bewildering
sense of disenchantment and shame. The highest
representative of Judaism had abandoned and betrayed
it! Chayim Benvenisti, the rabbi of Smyrna,
who had invested the false Messiah with authority
from motives far from honorable, almost died of
shame. Mahometans and Christians pointed with
scorn at the blind, credulous Jews. The street boys
in Turkey openly jeered at Jewish passers-by. But
this ridicule was not all. So widespread a commotion
could not die out and leave no trace. The
sultan thought of destroying all the Jews in his
empire, because they had formed rebellious plans,
and of ordering all children under seven to be
brought up in Islamism. The newly converted
Mahometan, Mehmed Effendi, in order to revenge
himself, is said to have betrayed his own plans, and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_156" id="Page_156">156</a></span>
the consent of the Jews thereto. Two councilors
and the sultana-mother are reported to have dissuaded
the sultan from his design by the observation
that the Jews ought to be regarded as having
been misled. Fifty chief rabbis, however, because
they had neglected their duty in teaching the people,
were to be executed&mdash;twelve from Constantinople,
twelve from Smyrna, and the remaining twenty-six
from the other communities in Turkey. It was regarded
as a special miracle that this resolution remained
a dead letter, and that the Jews did not even
have to pay a fine. The division in the communities
might have had even worse consequences, if the
unbelievers had heaped scorn and mockery upon
the late devotees. But the colleges of rabbis in
the East interposed, and sought to appease and
reconcile, and threatened to excommunicate any one
who, by word or deed, offended a former Sabbatian.</p>

<p>Although men's minds were calmed for the
moment, it was long before peace was restored.
After the first surprise at Sabbata√Ø's conversion was
over, his zealous followers, especially at Smyrna,
began to recover. They could not persuade themselves
that they had really been running after a
shadow. There must be, or have been, some truth
in Sabbata√Ø's Messianic claims, since all signs so
entirely agreed. The Kabbalists easily got over
objections. Sabbata√Ø had not turned Mahometan;
a phantom had played that part, while he himself
had retired to heaven or to the Ten Tribes, and
would soon appear again to accomplish the work of
redemption. As at the time of the origin of Christianity
mystical believers (Docet√¶) interpreted the
crucifixion of Jesus as a phantasm, so now thorough-going
mystics explained Sabbata√Ø's apostasy from
Judaism. Others, such as Samuel Primo, Jacob
Faliachi, Jacob Israel Duchan, who had designed,
through him, to bring about the fall of Rabbinical Judaism,
and would not abandon their plan lightly, still<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_157" id="Page_157">157</a></span>
clung to him. The prophets, who had been manifestly
proved false through his conversion, were
most interested in remaining true to him. They did
not care quietly to renounce their functions and
withdraw into obscurity, or be laughed at. The
prophets residing at Smyrna, Constantinople,
Rhodes, and Chios were silenced; but the itinerant
prophets, Nathan Ghazati and Sabbata√Ø Raphael, did
not choose to abdicate. The former had remained
in Palestine during Sabbata√Ø's triumph in order to
be paid homage on his own account. After the
deception was unmasked he regarded himself as no
longer safe; he made preparations to go to Smyrna,
and continued to send out his mystical, bombastic
letters. From Damascus he warned the Jews of
Aleppo by letter not to allow themselves to be discouraged
by strange circumstances in their belief
in the Messiah; there was a deep mystery shortly to
be revealed; but wherein the mystery consisted
could not yet be disclosed. By these circulars the
credulous were confirmed afresh in their delusion.
In Smyrna many synagogues continued to insert the
blessing for Sabbata√Ø in their prayers. Hence the
rabbis were obliged to interfere vigorously, especially
the rabbinate of the Turkish capital. They laid
under a ban all who should even pronounce the
name of Sabbata√Ø, or converse with his followers,
and threatened to hand them over to the secular
arm. Nathan Ghazati, in particular, was excommunicated,
and everyone warned against harboring
him or approaching him (Kislev 12, December 9,
1666). These sentences of excommunication were
so far effectual that Nathan could not stay anywhere
for any length of time, and even in Smyrna he could
remain only a short time in secret at the house of a
believer. But the rabbis were not able entirely to
exorcise the imposture. One of the most zealous
Sabbatians, probably Samuel Primo, who was ready
in invention, threw out a more effective suggestion<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_158" id="Page_158">158</a></span>
than that of the mock conversion. All had been
ordained as it had come to pass. Precisely by his
going over to Islam had Sabbata√Ø proved himself
the Messiah. It was a Kabbalistic mystery which
some writings had announced beforehand. As the
first redeemer Moses was obliged to reside for some
time at Pharaoh's court, not as an Israelite, but to
all appearance an Egyptian, even so must the last
redeemer live some time at a heathen court, apparently
a heathen, "outwardly sinful, but inwardly
pure." It was Sabbata√Ø's task to free the lost
emanations of the soul, which pervade even Mahometans,
and by identifying them with himself, as it were,
bring them back to the fountain-head. By redeeming
souls in all circles, he was most effectually
furthering the kingdom of the Messiah. This suggestion
was a lucky hit; it kindled anew the flame
of the imposture. It became a watchword for all
Sabbatians enabling them, with decency and a show
of reason, to profess themselves believers, and hold
together.</p>

<p>Nathan Ghazati also caught up this idea, and was
encouraged to resume his part as prophet. He had
fared badly so far; he had been obliged secretly to
leave Smyrna, where he had been in hiding several
months (end of April, 1667). His followers, consisting
of more than thirty men, were dispersed.
But by this new imposture he recovered courage,
and approached Adrianople, where Mehmed Effendi
presided, attended by several of his adherents, who
as pretended Mahometans lived and made fantastic
plans with him. The representatives of the Jewish
community at Constantinople and Adrianople
rightly feared fresh disturbances from the presence
of the false prophet, and desired to get rid of him.
Nathan Ghazati, however, relied on his prophecy,
which might possibly, he said, be fulfilled at the end
of the year. He expected the Holy Spirit to descend
upon the renegade Mehmed on the Feast of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_159" id="Page_159">159</a></span>
Weeks (Pentecost), and then he also would be able
to show signs and wonders. Until then, he defiantly
replied to the deputies, he could entertain no propositions.
When the Feast of Weeks was over,
the people of Adrianople again urged him to cease
from his juggleries. After much labor they obtained
only a written promise to keep at a distance of
twelve days' journey from the city, not to correspond
with Sabbata√Ø, not to assemble people round
him, and if by the end of the year the Redeemer did
not appear, to consider his prophecies false. In
spite of his written promise, this lying prophet continued
his agitation, and admonished the Sabbatians
in Adrianople to make known their continued adhesion
by the suspension of the fast on the 17th of
Tammuz. In this city there was a Sabbatian conventicle
under the leadership of a former disciple,
who stood in close connection with Mehmed Effendi.
The rabbinate of Adrianople did not know how to
check the mischievous course of this daring sect,
and were obliged to have recourse to falsehood.
They announced that the renegade had suddenly
appeared before the Jewish communal council, had
repented of his imposture, and laid the blame on
Nathan and Abraham Yachini, who had made him
their dupe. In this way the rabbinate succeeded in
deceiving the Sabbatians. The effect did not last
long. Nathan on the one hand, and Mehmed
Effendi's circle on the other, awakened new hope,
the number of believers again increased, and they
made a special point of not fasting on the 9th of Ab,
the birthday of their Messiah. The rabbinates of
Constantinople and Smyrna sought to repress this
imposture by the old means&mdash;excommunication and
threats of punishment (end of July)&mdash;but with little
success. The Sabbatians had a sort of hankering
after martyrdom in order to seal their faith. The
false prophet renewed his propagandism. He still
had some followers, including two Mahometans.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_160" id="Page_160">160</a></span>
At Salonica, the home of a swarm of Kabbalists, he
fared badly. The more easily did he find a hearing
in the communities of the islands of Chios and Corfu.
His hopes were however directed principally to
Italy.</p>

<p>Here also confusion continued to reign. The first
news of Sabbata√Ø's defection had not been confirmed,
as in consequence of the war in Crete the
ships of the Christians had been captured by the
Turks. Thus the Sabbatians were left free to maintain
their faith and denounce the report as false, especially
as encouraging letters arrived from Raphael
Joseph Chelebi of Cairo and others. The most absurd
stories of Sabbata√Ø's power and dignity at the
Porte were published in Italy, and found credence.
Moses Pinheiro, Sabbata√Ø's old companion, Raphael
Sofino at Leghorn, and the Amsterdam fanatics,
Isaac Naar and Abraham Pereira, who had gone to
Italy to search for the Messiah, had a special interest
in clinging to straws; they feared ridicule as
dupes. The ignorant mountebank and strolling
prophet, Sabbata√Ø Raphael, from the Morea, then
residing in Italy, was bent upon deception and fraud,
and appears to have reaped a good harvest there.
When at last there could be no doubt of Sabbata√Ø's
change of religion, Raphael turned his steps to Germany,
where, on account of defective postal arrangements
and the slight intercourse of Jews with the
outer world, they had only a vague idea of the
course of events, and took the most foolish stories
for truth. Sabbata√Ø Raphael was there regarded as
a prophet; but, as he expected greater gain from
the rich Amsterdam community, he betook himself
thither (September, 1667). Here also the imposture
continued. Ashamed that they, the shrewd
and educated Portuguese, should have been so signally
deceived, they at first placed no faith in the
news of Sabbata√Ø's treachery. Even the rabbis
Isaac Aboab, Raphael Moses d'Aguilar, and the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_161" id="Page_161">161</a></span>
philosophical sceptic Musaphia, remained staunch.
Justly Jacob Sasportas laughed them to scorn, especially
Musaphia, on account of his present unshaken
faith as contrasted with his former incredulity.</p>

<p>Meanwhile Nathan Ghazati, the prophet of Gaza
was pursuing his mischievous course in Italy. Coming
from Greece, he landed at Venice (end of
March, 1668), but the rabbinate and the council, who
had had warning of him, would not allow him to enter
the Ghetto. A Sabbatian interceded for him
with some Christians of rank, and under such protection
he could not be expelled. To cure those
who had shared in the delusion, the rabbinate wrung
from him a written confession, that his prophecies
of Sabbata√Ø Zevi's Messiahship rested on a freak of
his imagination, that he recognized them as such,
and held them to be idle. This confession was
printed with an introduction by the rabbinate of
Venice, in order at last to open the eyes of the Sabbatians
in Italy. But it was not of much avail. The
delusion, resting as it did on the Kabbala, was too
deeply rooted. From Venice Ghazati was sent to
Leghorn, with the suggestion to render him innocuous
there, where Jews enjoyed more freedom; but
Nathan Ghazati secretly escaped to Rome, cut off
his beard, disguised himself, and is said to have
thrown notes written in Chaldee into the Tiber, to
bring about the destruction of Rome. The Jews
recognized him, and, since they feared danger for
themselves on papal soil from his fraudulent absurdities,
they procured his banishment. Then he went
to Leghorn, and found followers there also. Promising
himself more honor and profit in Turkey, or
more opportunity to satisfy his restless mind,
Nathan returned to Adrianople. He did not pay
great regard to word and oath. Nathan Ghazati
compiled much Kabbalistic nonsense, but acquired
no fame. He is said to have died at Sophia, and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_162" id="Page_162">162</a></span>
to have been laid in a vault dug by himself (1680).
Other men appeared at the head of the Sabbatians
who far surpassed him, and pursued a definite end.</p>

<p>Sabbata√Ø, or Mehmed Effendi, at this time began
his revolutionary chimeras afresh. Immediately after
his apostasy he was obliged, under the direction
of the mufti Vanni, to acquire Mahometan ways, and
guard carefully against any appearance of inclination
to Judaism and the Jews. He therefore figured
as a pious Mahometan. Gradually he was permitted
greater freedom, and to give utterance to his
Kabbalistic views about God and the universe.
Vanni, to whom much was new, heard his expositions
with curiosity, and the sultan also is said to have
listened to his words attentively. Probably Sabbata√Ø
won over some Mahometans to his Kabbalistic
dreams. Weary of quiet, and anxious to play
an active part again, he once more entered into close
relations with Jews, and gave out that he had been
filled anew with the Holy Spirit at Passover (end
of March, 1668), and had received revelations. Sabbata√Ø,
or one of his aiders and abettors, published a
mystical work ("Five Evidences of the Faith," Sahaduta
di Mehemnuta) addressed to the Jews and
couched in extravagant language, in which the following
fantastic views were set forth: Sabbata√Ø had
been and remained the true Redeemer; it would
be easy to prove himself such, if he had not compassion
on Israel, who would have to experience the
same dreadful sufferings as the Messiah; and he
only persisted in Mahometanism in order to bring
thousands and tens of thousands of non-Jews over
to Israel. To the sultan and the mufti, on the other
hand, he said that his approximation to the Jews
was intended to bring them over to Islam. He received
permission to associate with Jews, and to
preach before them at Adrianople, even in synagogues.
Thus he played the part of Jew at one
time, of Mussulman at another. If Turkish spies<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_163" id="Page_163">163</a></span>
were present, his Jewish hearers knew how to deceive
them. They threw away their Jewish headdress,
and put on the turban. It is probable that
many Jews were seriously converted to Islam, and
a Jewish-Turkish sect thus began to form round
Sabbata√Ø Zevi. The Jews who had hitherto felt such
horror of apostatizing, that only the outcasts
amongst them went over to Christianity or Islam,
became less severe. They said without indignation
that so and so had adopted the turban. Through
such jugglery Sabbatians at Adrianople, Smyrna,
Salonica, and other cities, even in Palestine, allowed
themselves to be confirmed in their obstinate faith
in the Messiah. Even pious men, learned in the
Talmud, continued to adhere to him.</p>

<p>As though this complication were to become more
involved, and the Kabbalistic-Messianic disorder
were to be pursued to its utmost limits, a Sabbatian
champion unexpectedly appeared in a man of European
culture, not wanting in gifts, Abraham Michael
Cardoso. He was an original character, a living
personification of the transformation of the Portuguese
Jews after their expulsion. Born of Marrano
parents in a small town of Portugal, Celarico, in the
province of Be√Øra, Miguel Cardoso, like his elder
brother Fernando, studied medicine. While the
latter devoted himself earnestly to science, Miguel
dawdled away his days amidst the luxury of Madrid,
sang love-songs with the guitar under the balconies
of fair ladies, and paid very little heed to Kabbala
or Judaism. What influenced him to leave Spain
is not known. Perhaps his more serious and
thoughtful brother, who, after making a name in
Spain as a medical and scientific author, out of love
to Judaism migrated to Venice, where he plunged
deeply into Jewish literature, infected him with enthusiasm.
Both brothers assumed Jewish names
after their return to the religion of their forefathers.
The elder, Isaac Cardoso, gave up his name Fernando;<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_164" id="Page_164">164</a></span>
the younger took the name of Abraham in
addition to that of Miguel (Michael). Both composed
verses in Spanish. While the elder brother
led a regular life, guided by moral principles and a
rational faith, the younger fell under the sway of extravagant
fancy and an eccentric manner of living.
Isaac Cardoso (born 1615, died after 1680) conferred
renown on Judaism, while Abraham Michael
Cardoso (born about 1630, died 1706) was a disgrace
to it.</p>

<p>The latter lived as a physician at Leghorn, but
not flourishing he accepted the position of physician
in ordinary to the Bey of Tripoli. His warm-blooded,
dissolute nature was a hindrance to his
advancement. Contrary to the custom of African
Jews, he married two wives, and instead of employing
himself with his difficult science, he revolved
fantastical schemes. Cardoso appears to have been
initiated into the Kabbala and the Sabbatian delusion
by Moses Pinheiro, who was living at Leghorn.</p>

<p>He continually had dreams and visions, which increased
in frequency after the public appearance of
Sabbata√Ø at Smyrna and Constantinople. He communicated
his delusion to his wives and domestics,
who likewise pretended to have seen all sorts of apparitions.
The apostasy of the false Messiah from
Judaism did not cure Cardoso of his delusion; he
remained a zealous partisan, and even justified the
treachery of the Messiah by saying that it was necessary
for him to be counted among sinners, in order
that he might atone for Israel's sin of idolatry,
and blot it out. He sent circulars in all directions,
in order to support the Messianic claim of Sabbata√Ø,
and figure as a prophet. In vain his more sober
brother, Isaac Cardoso, warned and ridiculed him,
asking him ironically, whether he had received the
gift of prophecy from his former gallantries and
from playing the guitar for the fair maidens of Madrid.
Abraham Cardoso's frivolity was in no way<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_165" id="Page_165">165</a></span>
lessened, he even assumed a didactic tone towards
his grave elder brother, who despised the Kabbala
as he did alchemy and astrology, and sent him numberless
proofs, from the Zohar and other Kabbalistic
writings, that Sabbata√Ø was the true Messiah, and
that he must necessarily be estranged from Judaism.
By his zeal he gained many adherents for the Sabbatian
delusion in Africa; but he also made enemies,
and incurred dangers. He continued to prophesy
the speedy commencement of the Messiah's reign,
although often proved false by reality. He put off
the event from year to year, performed Kabbalistic
tricks, set up a new God for Israel, and at last declared
himself the Messiah of the house of Ephraim,
until he was rigorously prosecuted by an opponent
of these vagaries. Cardoso was driven back to his
former uncomfortable position, forced to lead an
adventurer's life, and win bread for himself and his
family, so to speak, by his delusions, going through
all sorts of jugglery, at Smyrna, at Constantinople,
in the Greek islands, and at Cairo, and promoting
the Sabbatian delusions with his abundant knowledge,
eloquent tongue, and ready pen. Thanks to
his education in Christian schools, he was far superior
to other Sabbatian apostles, and knew how to
give an air of rationality and wisdom to nonsense,
thus completely blinding the biased, and stultifying
even those averse to the Sabbatian movement.</p>

<p>Encouraged by the support of the Jews, continued
in spite of his change of religion, Sabbata√Ø persisted
in keeping up his character as Messiah, and associated
more and more with Jews. His weak brain
had been turned by the overwhelming rush of events,
and he completely lost balance. At one time he reviled
Judaism and the God of Israel with foul words
of abuse, and is said even to have informed against
Jews as blasphemers of Islam before Turkish magistrates.
At other times he held divine service according
to the Jewish ritual with his Jewish followers,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_166" id="Page_166">166</a></span>
sang psalms, expounded the Zohar, ordered
selections from the Torah to be read on the Sabbath,
and frequently chose seven virgins for that purpose.
On account of his constant intercourse with Jews,
whom he was not able to bring over wholesale to
Mahometanism, as he may have boastfully asserted,
Mehmed Effendi is said to have fallen into disfavor,
forfeited his allowance and been banished from Adrianople
to Constantinople. He finally married
another wife, the daughter of a man learned in the
Talmud, Joseph Philosoph of Salonica. The Turkish
patrol having surprised him in a village (Kuru
Gisme) near Constantinople, while singing psalms
in a tent with some Jews, and the Bostanji Bashi
(officer) having reported it, the grand vizir commanded
the Kaimakam to banish him to Dulcigno,
a small town in Albania, where no Jews dwelt.
There he died, abandoned and forsaken, it was
afterwards said, on the Day of Atonement, 1676.</p>

<p>Spinoza, who had likewise broken away from
Judaism, may well have looked with great contempt
on this Messianic craze of his contemporaries. If
he had cared to dig the grave of Judaism and bury
it, he would have been obliged to recognize Sabbata√Ø
Zevi, his private secretary, Samuel Primo, and
his prophets, as allies and abettors. The irrationality
of the Kabbala brought Judaism much more
effectually into discredit than reason and philosophy.
It is a remarkable fact that neither the one nor the
other could wean the numerous cultured Jews of
Amsterdam from the religion of their forefathers,
so strongly was it rooted in their hearts. At this
time when two forces of Jewish origin were antagonizing
Judaism in the East and the West, the Portuguese
community, increased to the number of four
thousand families, undertook (1671) the building of a
splendid synagogue, and after some years finished
the huge work, which had been interrupted by war
troubles. The dedication of the synagogue (Ab 10,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_167" id="Page_167">167</a></span>
August 2, 1675), was celebrated with great solemnity
and pomp. Neither the first Temple of Solomon,
nor the second of Zerubbabel, nor the third of
Herod, was so much lauded with song and eloquent
speech as the new one at Amsterdam, called Talmud
Torah. Copper-plate engravings, furnished
with inscriptions in verse, were published. Christians
likewise took part in the dedication. They
advanced money to the Jews in the times of need,
and a poet, Romein de Hooghe, composed verses
in honor of the synagogue and the Jewish people in
Latin, Dutch, and French.</p>

<p>Spinoza lived to see this rejoicing of the community
from which he had become a pervert. He
happened to be at Amsterdam just at the time.
He was engaged in seeing through the press a
treatise (Ethics) which reversed the views hitherto
prevailing, and the second, enlarged edition of his
other work, chiefly directed against Judaism. He
may have laughed at the joy of the Amsterdam Jews,
as idle; but the building of this synagogue in a city
which a hundred years before had tolerated no Jews
and had supported a Spanish Inquisition, was loud
testimony of the times, and contradicted many of his
assertions. He died not long afterwards, or rather,
passed gently away as with a divine kiss (February
21, 1677), about five months after Sabbata√Ø Zevi.
Against his will he has contributed to the glory of
the race which he so unjustly reviled. His powerful
intellect, logical acumen, and strength of character
are more and more recognized as properties which
he owed to the race from which he was descended.
Among educated Jews, Isaac Orobio de Castro
alone attempted a serious refutation of Spinoza's
philosophical views. Though his intention was good,
he was too weak to break through the close meshes
of Spinoza's system. It was left to history to refute
it with facts.</p>

<p>The princes and nations of Europe and Asia
showed great consideration in not disturbing the
Messianic farce of the Jews, who were quietly allowed
to make themselves ridiculous. A pause had
come in the constantly recurring persecution of the
Jews, which did not, however, last very long. The
regular succession of accusations, vexations, and
banishments soon re-commenced. The contrast
between the followers of Mahomet and those of
Jesus is very striking. In Turkey the Jews were
free from persecution, in spite of their great excitement,
and absurd dreams of a national Messiah. In
Africa, Sid Gailand and later Muley Arshid, sultan
of Tafilet, Fez, and Morocco, oppressed the Jews,
partly on account of their activity, partly from
rapacity. But this ceased with the next sovereign,
Muley Ismail. He was a patron of the Jews, and
entrusted several with important posts. He had
two Jewish advisers, Daniel Toledano of Miquenes,
a friend of Jacob Sasportas, a Talmudist and
experienced in state affairs, and Joseph Maimaran,
likewise from Miquenes.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_169" id="Page_169">169</a></span>
Within Christendom, on the contrary, Jews were
esteemed and treated as men only in Holland; in
other states they were regarded as outcasts, who
had no rights, and no claim to compassion. Spain
again led the way in decreeing banishments. That
unfortunate country, becoming more and more depopulated
through despotism, superstition, and the
Inquisition, was then ruled by a foolish, fanatical
woman, the dowager-regent Maria Anna of Austria,
who had made her father-confessor, the German
Jesuit Neidhard, inquisitor-general and minister
with unlimited powers. Naturally, no toleration
of other religions could be suffered at this bigoted
court. There were still Jews in some parts
of the monarchy, in the north-western corner of
Africa, in Oran, Maxarquivir, and other cities. Many
had rendered considerable services to the Spanish
crown, in times of peace and war, against the native
Arabs, or Moors, who endured with inward rage the
dominion of the cross. The families of Cansino and
Sasportas, the former royal interpreters, or dragomans,
for the province of Oran, had distinguished
themselves especially by their fidelity and devotion
to Spain; and their conduct had been recognized by
Philip IV, the husband of Maria Anna, in a special
letter. Nevertheless, the queen-dowager suddenly
ordered the banishment of the Jews from the district,
because she could no longer tolerate people
of this race in her realm. At the urgent request of
Jewish grandees the governor allowed the Jews
eight days' grace during the Passover, and admitted
that they were banished, not because of misconduct
or treason, but simply on account of the regent's
intolerance (end of April, 1669). They were
obliged to sell their possessions in haste at ridiculous
prices. The exiles settled in the district of
Savoy, at Villafranca, near Nice.</p>

<p>Like mother, like daughter. At about this time
the banishment of Jews from Vienna and the arch-<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_170" id="Page_170">170</a></span>duchy
of Austria was decreed at the instigation of
the daughter of the Spanish regent, the empress
Margaret, an ally of the Jesuits. The emperor did
not easily allow himself to be prejudiced against
Jews, from whom he derived a certain revenue. The
community of Vienna alone, grown to nearly two
thousand souls, paid a yearly tax of 10,000, and the
country community of 4,000, florins. Including the
income from Jews in other places, the emperor received
from them 50,000 florins annually. But an empress
need not trouble herself about finance; she can
follow the inclinations of her heart, and Margaret's
heart, filled with Jesuitism, hated Jews profoundly,
and her father-confessor strengthened the feeling.
Having met with an accident at a ball, she wished
to testify her gratitude to heaven which had wonderfully
preserved her, and could find no means more
acceptable to God than the misery of Jews. More
urgently than before she entreated her imperial consort
to banish from the capital and the country the
Jews, described by her father-confessor as outcasts
of hell, and she received his promise. With trumpet-sound
it was made known in Vienna (February 14,
1670) that by the emperor's command the Jews were
to quit the city within a few months on pain of death.
They left no measure untried to avert the stroke.
Often before had similar resolutions been recalled
by Austrian emperors. The Jews cited the privileges
accorded them in writing, and the services
which they had rendered the imperial house. They
offered large sums of money (there were very rich
court Jews at Vienna), used the influence of persons
connected with the court, and, after a solemn service
in honor of the recovery of the emperor from sickness,
presented him as he left the church with a large
gold cup, and the empress with a handsome silver
basin and jug. The presents were accepted, but the
command was not recalled.</p>

<p>At Vienna and at the court there was no prospect<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_171" id="Page_171">171</a></span>
of a change of purpose; the Jesuits had the upper
hand through the empress and her confessor. The
community of Vienna in despair thought to avert
the evil by another, roundabout course. The Jews
of Germany had felt sincere sympathy for their
brethren, and had implored heaven by prayer and
fasting to save them. The Jews of Vienna could
count confidently upon their zeal. Therefore, in a
pitiful letter to the most influential and perhaps the
richest Jew of that time, Isaac (Manoel) Texeira, the
esteemed agent of Queen Christina, they begged
him to exert his influence with temporal and church
princes, through them to make Empress Margaret
change her mind. Texeira had previously taken
active steps in that direction, and he promised to
continue them. He had written to some Spanish
grandees with whom he stood in close connection to
use their influence with the empress's confessor.
The queen of Sweden, who, after her romantic conversion
to Catholicism, enjoyed great esteem in the
Catholic world, led Texeira to hope that, by letters
addressed to the papal nuncio, to the empress, and
to her mother, the Spanish regent, she might prevent
the banishment of the Austrian Jews. The
Jews of Rome also did their part to save their
threatened brethren. But all these efforts led to
nothing. Unhappily there had just been a papal
election at Rome after the death of Clement IX, so
that the head of the church, though Jews were tolerated
in his states, could not be prevailed upon to
assume a decided attitude. Emperor Leopold remained
firm, and disposed of the houses of the Jews
before they had left them. He was only humane
enough to order, under pain of severe punishment,
that no harm be done to the departing Jews.</p>

<p>So the Jews had to submit to the iron will of necessity,
and grasp their pilgrims' staffs. When 1,400
souls had fallen into distress, or at least into an
anxious plight, and many had succumbed, the remainder,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_172" id="Page_172">172</a></span>
more than three hundred, again petitioned
the emperor, recounting the services of Jews to the
imperial house, and showing all the accusations
against them to be groundless, at all events not
proven. They did not shrink from declaring that
to be a Jew could not be called a crime, and protested
that they ought to be treated as Roman citizens,
who ought not to be summarily expelled.
They begged at least for a respite until the next
meeting of the Reichstag. Even this petition, in
which they referred to the difficulty of finding a refuge,
if the emperor, the ruler of half of Europe,
rejected them, remained without effect. All had to
depart; only one family, that of the court factor,
Marcus Schlesinger Jaffa, was allowed to remain in
Vienna, on account of services rendered. The
Jesuits were full of joy, and proclaimed the praise
of God in a gradual. The magistrates bought the
Jews' quarter from the emperor for 100,000 florins,
and called it Leopoldstadt in his honor. The site
of the synagogue was used for a church, of which
the emperor laid the corner-stone (August 18, 1670)
in honor of his patron saint. A golden tablet was
to perpetuate the shameful deeds of the Jews:</p>

<blockquote>

<p>"After the Jews were banished, the emperor caused their synagogue,
which had been as a charnel-house, to be made into a house
of God."</p></blockquote>

<p>The tablet, however, only proves the mental
weakness of the emperor and his people. The Talmud
school (Beth ha-Midrash) was likewise converted
into a church, and named in honor of the
empress and her patron saint.</p>

<p>But this dark picture had also its bright side. A
struggling state, which hitherto had not tolerated
the Jews, now became a new, though not very hospitable,
home, where the Jewish race was rejuvenated.
The Austrian exiles dispersed in various
directions. Many sought protection in Moravia,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_173" id="Page_173">173</a></span>
Bohemia, and Poland. Others went to Venice and as
far as the Turkish frontiers, others turned to F√ºrth,
in Bavaria. Fifty families were received by Elector
Frederick William, in the Mark of Brandenburg.
This great prince, who laid the solid foundation for
the future greatness of the Prussian monarchy, was
not more tolerant than other princes of Louis XIV's
century; but he was more clear-sighted than Emperor
Leopold, and recognized that a sound state
of finances is essential to the prosperity of a state,
and that Jews retained somewhat of their old renown
as financiers. In the Mark of Brandenburg no Jew
had been allowed to dwell for a hundred years, since
their expulsion under Elector John George. Frederick
William himself took the step so difficult for
many; he wrote (April, 1670) to his ambassador,
Andrew Neumann, at Vienna, that he was inclined
to receive into the electoral Mark from forty to fifty
prosperous Jewish families of the exiles from Vienna
under certain conditions and limitations. The conditions,
made known a year later, proved in many
points very harsh, but were more favorable than in
other Protestant countries, as, for instance, in the
bigoted city of Hamburg. The Jews might settle
where they pleased in Brandenburg and in the duchy
of Crossen, and might trade everywhere without
hindrance. The burgomasters were directed to
place no impediment in the way of their settlement
and not to molest them. Every family had to pay
eight thalers a year as a protective tax, a gold florin
for every marriage, and the same for every funeral;
on the other hand, they were freed from the poll-tax
throughout the country. They might buy and build
houses, on condition that after the expiration of a
term they sell them to Christians. They were not
permitted to have synagogues, but could have
prayer-rooms, and appoint a school-master and a
butcher (Shochet). This charter of protection was
valid for only twenty years, but a prospect was held<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_174" id="Page_174">174</a></span>
out that it would be prolonged by the elector or his
successor. Of these fifty Austrian families, some
seven settled in Berlin, and formed the foundation
of the community afterwards so large and influential.
One step led to another. Frederick William also
admitted rich Jews from Hamburg, Glogau, and
other cities, and thus communities sprang up at
Landsberg and Frankfort-on-the-Oder.</p>

<p>It is evident that Frederick William admitted the
Jews purely from financial considerations. But he
occasionally showed unselfish goodwill towards
some. When he agreed to the quixotic plan of
Skytte, a Swedish royal councilor, to found, at Tangerm√ºnde
in the Mark, a university for all sciences
and an asylum for persecuted savants, he did not
fail, according to his programme, to admit into this
Athens of the Mark, Jewish men of learning, as well
as Arabs and unbelievers of every kind, but on condition
that they should keep their errors to themselves,
and not spread them abroad.</p>

<p>At another spot in Christian Europe a few rays
of light pierced the darkness. About the same time
that the Jews were expelled from Vienna, a false accusation,
which might have had far-reaching consequences,
cropped up against the Jews of a city recently
brought under French rule. In Metz, a considerable
community had developed in the course
of a century from four Jewish families, and had appointed
its own rabbi since the beginning of the
seventeenth century. The Jews of Metz behaved
so well that King Louis XIV publicly declared his
satisfaction with them, and renewed their privileges.
But as Metz at that time still had a German population,
narrow guilds continued to exist, and these
insisted upon limiting the Jews in their occupations.
Thwarted by the magistrates, some of them roused
in the populace a burning hatred of the Jews. A
peasant had lost a child, and the news was quickly
spread that the Jews had killed it to practice sorcery<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_175" id="Page_175">175</a></span>
with its flesh. The accusation was brought specifically
against a peddler, Raphael Levi. Scraps of paper
with Hebrew letters, written by him during his imprisonment,
served as proofs of his guilt. A baptized
Jew, Paul du Valli√© (Vallier, formerly Isaac),
son of a famous physician in that district, with the
aid of another Jewish convert, translated the scraps
to the disadvantage of the accused.</p>

<p>Du Valli√© had literally been decoyed into Christianity,
and changed into a bitter enemy of his
former co-religionists. He had been a good son,
adored by his parents. He had also been a pious
Jew, and had declared to two tempters who had
tried to influence him to apostatize from Judaism
that he would sooner be burned. Nevertheless, the
priests continued their efforts until they induced him
to accept Christianity. The news of his baptism
broke the heart of his mother, Antoinette. A touching
letter to her son, in French, is still extant, in
which she entreats him to return to Judaism. Du
Valli√© however refused, and proved himself besides
to be a bad man and a traitor. He brought false
evidence against the poor accused Jew. Accordingly,
Raphael Levi was stretched on the rack, and,
though he maintained his innocence in the tone of
convincing truth, he was condemned by the Metz
parliament, and put to death with torture, which he
resolutely bore (January, 1670). The parliament
intended to continue the persecution. The enemies
of the Jews, moreover, caused a document on the
subject to be printed and widely circulated, in order
to produce the proper effect. But the Metz community
found a supporter in a zealous fellow-believer,
Jonah Salvador, a tobacco dealer, of Pignerol. He
was learned in the Talmud, and a follower of Sabbata√Ø
Zevi. Richard Simon, an eager student,
sought him out in order to study Hebrew under his
guidance. Jonah Salvador managed to interest this
Father of the Oratory in the Metz community, and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_176" id="Page_176">176</a></span>
inspired him to draw up a vindication of the Jews
respecting child-murder. The tobacco merchant of
Pignerol delivered this document to persons at court
whose word had weight, and this turned the scale.
The king's council ordered the records of the Metz
parliament to be sent in, and decided (end of 1671)
that judicial murder had been committed in the case
of Raphael Levi. Louis XIV ordered that henceforth
criminal charges against Jews be brought before
the king's council.</p>

<p>Inhuman treatment of Jews, banishment, false accusations
against them, and massacres did not actually
cease, but their number and extent diminished.
This phenomenon was a consequence of the increasing
civilization of the European capitals, but a growing
predilection for the Jews and their brilliant literature
had a share in their improved treatment. Educated
Christians, Catholics as well as Protestants,
and sober, unbiased men, whose judgment had
weight, began to be astonished at the continued
existence of this people. How was it that a people,
persecuted for ten centuries and more, trampled
under foot, and treated like a pack of venomous or
noisome beasts&mdash;a people without a home, whom all
the world treated roughly&mdash;how was it that this
people still existed&mdash;not only existed, but formed a
compact body, separate from other peoples, even in
its subjection too proud to mingle with more powerful
nations? Numerous writers appeared as apologists
for the Jews, urging their milder treatment,
and appealing earnestly to Christians not to destroy
or disfigure this living marvel. Many went very far
in their enthusiasm for the Jews. The Huguenot
preacher, Pierre Jurieu, at Rotterdam, wrote a book
(1685) on "The Fulfillment of Prophecy," in which
he expounded the future greatness of the Jews as
certain&mdash;that God had kept this nation for Himself
in order to do great wonders for it: the true Antichrist
was the persecution of Jews. A Dane, Oliger<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_177" id="Page_177">177</a></span>
(Holger) Pauli, displayed over-zealous activity for
the return of the Jewish people to their former
country. As a youth, he had had visions of the
coming greatness of Israel, in which he also was to
play a part. Oliger Pauli was so fond of the Jewish
race that, although descended from Christian ancestors
of noble rank, he always gave out that he
had sprung from Jewish stock. He had amassed
millions as a merchant, and spent them lavishly on
his hobby, the return of the Jews to Palestine. He
sent mystical letters to King William III of England
and the dauphin of France to induce them to undertake
the assembling and restoration of the Jews. To
the dauphin the Danish enthusiast plainly declared
that by zeal for the Jews, France might atone for
her bloody massacre of St. Bartholomew and the
dragonnades. John Peter Speeth of Augsburg,
born of Catholic parents at Vienna, went still farther
in his enthusiasm for Jews and Judaism. After
writing a pamphlet in honor of Catholicism, he went
over to the Socinians and Mennonites, and at last
became a Jew at Amsterdam, and took the name of
Moses Germanus (died April 17, 1702). He confessed
that precisely the false accusations against
Jews had inspired him with disgust for Christianity.</p>

<blockquote>

<p>"Even at the present time much of the same sort of thing happens
in Poland and Germany, where circumstantial tales are told and songs
sung in the streets, how the Jews have murdered a child, and sent the
blood to one another in quills for the use of their women in childbirth.
I have discovered this outrageous fraud in time, and abandoned Christianity,
which can permit such things, in order to have no share in it,
nor be found with those who trample under foot Israel, the first begotten
Son of God, and shed his blood like water."</p></blockquote>

<p>Moses Germanus was Paul reversed. The latter
as a Christian, became a zealous despiser of Judaism;
the former, as a Jew, an equally fanatical opponent
of Christianity. He regarded its origin as
gross fraud. One cannot even now write all that
Moses Germanus uttered about the teaching of
Jesus. He was not the only Christian who at this<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_178" id="Page_178">178</a></span>
time "from love for Judaism" exposed himself to
the painful operation and still keener shame and
reproach of circumcision. In one year three Christians,
in free Amsterdam to be sure, went over to
Judaism, amongst them a student from Prague.</p>

<p>Even more than the anticipated greatness of Israel,
Jewish literature attracted learned Christians,
and inspired them with a sort of sympathy for the
people out of whose mine such treasures came.
The Hebrew language was studied by Christians
even more than in the beginning of the seventeenth
century. In the middle and towards the close of
that century Hebrew Rabbinical literature was most
eagerly searched, translated into Latin or modern
languages, quoted, utilized, and applied. "Jewish
learning" was, not as before a mere ornament, but
an indispensable element, of learning. It was regarded
as a disgrace for Catholic and Protestant
theologians to be ignorant of Rabbinical lore, and
the ignorant could defend themselves only by abusing
these Hebraists as semi-rabbis.</p>

<p>The first Catholic critic, Father Richard Simon,
of the congregation of the Oratory at Paris, contributed
very much to the high esteem in which the
Jews and their literature were held. This man, who
laid the foundation of a scientific, philological, and
exegetical study of the Old and New Testament, investigated
Jewish writings with great zeal, and utilized
them for his purpose. He was gifted with a
keen understanding, which unconsciously led him
beyond the limits of Catholic doctrine. Spinoza's
criticism of the Bible induced him to make original
inquiries, and since, as a genuine Frenchman, he
was endowed with sound sense rather than metaphysical
imagination, he was more successful, and
his method is thoroughly scientific. Richard Simon
was disgusted with the biblical exegesis of the Protestants,
who were wont to support their wisdom and
their stupidity with verses of Holy Scripture. He<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_179" id="Page_179">179</a></span>
undertook, therefore, to prove that the biblical
knowledge and biblical exegesis of the Protestant
church, on which it prided itself before Catholics and
Jews, was mere mist and error, because it mistook
the sense of the original text, and had no conception
of the historical background, the coloring of time and
place, of the books of the Bible, and in this ignorance
multiplied absurd dogmas.</p>

<blockquote>

<p>"You Protestants appeal to the pure word of God to do battle
against the Catholic tradition; I intend to withdraw the ground from
under you, and to leave you, so to speak, with your legs dangling in
the air."</p></blockquote>

<p>Richard Simon was the predecessor of Reimarus
and David Strauss. The Catholics applauded him&mdash;even
the mild Bishop Bossuet, who at first had
opposed him from conceit&mdash;not dreaming that they
were nourishing a serpent in their bosom. In his
masterpiece, "The Critical History of The Old
Testament," he set himself to prove that the written
word in no way suffices for faith. Richard Simon
appreciated with a master's eye, as no one before
him, the wide extent of a new science&mdash;biblical criticism.
Although he criticised freely, he proceeded
apologetically, vindicated the sacred character of the
Bible, and repelled Spinoza's attacks upon its trustworthiness.
Richard Simon's writings, which were
composed not in Latin, but in the vernacular, were
marked by a certain elegance of style, and attracted
well-deserved attention. They form an agreeable
contrast to the chaos of oppressive learning of the
time, and have an insinuative air about them.
Hence they were eagerly read by the educated
classes, even by women. Simon accorded much
space to Jewish literature, and subjoined a list of
Jewish writers. By this means Rabbinical literature
became known to the educated more than through
the efforts of Reuchlin, Scaliger, the two Buxtorfs,
and the learned men of Holland who wrote in Latin.</p>

<p>To gain a comprehensive knowledge of this literature,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_180" id="Page_180">180</a></span>
Richard Simon was obliged, like Reuchlin
before him, to seek intercourse with Jews; in particular
he associated with Jonah Salvador, the Italian
Sabbatian. By this means he lost a part of his
prejudice against Jews, which still existed in France
in its intensity. He was drawn to Jews in another
direction. Laying stress on Catholic tradition as
opposed to the literal belief of the Protestants, he
felt in some degree related to the Talmudists
and Rabbanites. They also upheld their tradition
against the literal belief of the Karaites. Richard
Simon, therefore, exalted Rabbinical Judaism in the
introduction and supplements which he added to his
translation of Leo Modena's "Rites." Familiar
with the whole of Jewish literature as few of his
time or of a later period, Richard Simon refrained
from making the boastful assertion, grounded upon
ignorance, that Christianity is something peculiar,
fundamentally different to Judaism and far more
exalted. He recognized, and had the courage to
declare, the truth that Christianity in its substance
and form was molded after the pattern of Judaism,
and would have to become like it again.</p>

<blockquote>

<p>"Since the Christian religion has its origin in Judaism, I doubt not
that the perusal of this little book (the 'Rites') will contribute to the
understanding of the New Testament, on account of its similarity to,
and close connection with the Old. They who composed it were
Jews, and it can be explained only by means of Judaism. A portion
of our ceremonies also are derived from the Jews.... The Christian
religion has this besides in common with the Jewish, that each is
based on Holy Scripture, on the tradition of the fathers, on traditional
habits and customs.... One cannot sufficiently admire the
modesty and devotion of the Jews, as they go to prayer in the morning....
The Jews distinguish themselves, not only by prayers, but
also by deeds of mercy, and one thinks one sees, in their sympathy
for the poor, the image of the love of the first Christians for their
brethren. Men obeyed in those times what the Jews have retained to
this day, while we (Christians) have scarcely kept up the remembrance
of it."</p></blockquote>

<p>Richard Simon almost deplored that the Jews,
formerly so learned in France, who looked upon
Paris as their Athens, had been driven out of that<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_181" id="Page_181">181</a></span>
country. He defended them against the accusation
of their hatred of Christians, and emphasized the
fact that they pray for the welfare of the state and
its princes. His predilection for tradition went so
far, that he maintained that the college of cardinals
at Rome, the supreme court of Christendom, was
formed on the pattern of the Synhedrion at Jerusalem,
and that the pope corresponded to the president,
the Nassi. Whilst he compared the Catholics
to the Rabbanites, he called the Protestants Karaites,
and jestingly wrote to his Protestant friends,
"My dear Karaites." It has been mentioned that
Richard Simon interested himself zealously in the
Jews of Metz, when they were accused of murdering
a Christian child. When other opportunities offered,
he defended the Jews against false accusations and
suspicions. A baptized Jew, Christian Gerson, who
had become a Protestant pastor, at the beginning of
the seventeenth century, in order to vilify the
Talmud, had made extracts in the shape of ridiculous
legends, printed and published in many editions.
Richard Simon wrote to a Swiss, about to translate
these German extracts into French, that Gerson was
not guiltless of having passed off plays upon words
and purely allegorical expressions in the Talmud as
serious narratives. Gerson imputed to the whole
Jewish nation certain errors, accepted only by the
credulous, unable to distinguish fiction from fact, and
he, therefore, abused the Talmud. It must not be
forgotten that it was a distinguished ecclesiastic,
moreover, a sober, moderate man, who spoke thus
favorably of Judaism. His books and letters, written
in a lively French style, and much read by the
educated world, gained many friends for Judaism,
or at least lessened the number of its enemies. The
official Catholic world, however, appears to have
reprimanded this eulogist of Judaism, and Richard
Simon, who loved peace, was obliged partially to
recant his praises.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_182" id="Page_182">182</a></span></p>

<blockquote>

<p>"I have said too much good of this wretched nation, and through
intercourse with some of them I have since learned to know them."</p></blockquote>

<p>This cannot have been spoken from his heart, for
he was not wont to judge a whole class of men
by a few individuals.</p>

<p>The attention paid to Jews and their literature by
Christian scholars and princes here and there produced
droll occurrences. In Sweden, the most bigoted
Protestant country, no Jew and no Catholic were
allowed to dwell. Nevertheless King Charles XI
felt extraordinary interest in the Jews, still more in
the Karaites, who pretended to follow the simple
word of God without the accretion of traditions, and
were said to bear great resemblance to the Protestants.
Would it not be easy to bring over to
Christianity these people who were not entangled in
the web of the Talmud? Charles XI accordingly
sent a professor of Upsala, learned in Hebrew
literature, Gustavus Peringer of Lilienblad (about
1690), to Poland for the purpose of seeking out the
Karaites, informing himself of their manner of life
and their customs, and especially buying their writings
without regard to cost. Provided with letters
of recommendation to the king of Poland, Peringer
went first to Lithuania, where dwelt several Karaite
communities. But the Polish and Lithuanian Karaites
were even more degraded than their brethren
in Constantinople, the Crimea, and Egypt. There
were very few among them who knew any details
about their origin and the history of their sect; not
one had accurate information. At about this time
the Polish king, John Sobieski, had ordered, through
a Karaite judge, Abraham ben Samuel of Trok, who
was in favor with him, that the Karaites, for some
unknown object, scatter from their headquarters of
Trok, Luzk, and Halicz, and settle also in other
small towns; they obeyed, and dispersed as far as
the northern province of Samogitia. These Polish
Karaites, cut off from their center, isolated, avoiding<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_183" id="Page_183">183</a></span>
intercourse with rabbis, and mixing only with the
Polish rustic population, became more and more
boorish, and sank into profound lethargy.</p>

<p>Whether Peringer even partially fulfilled the wish
of his king is not known; probably he altogether
failed in his mission. Some years later (1696&ndash;1697),
two learned Swedes, probably also commissioned
by Charles XI, traveled in Lithuania to visit Karaite
communities and buy up their writings. At the
same time they invited Karaites to visit Sweden,
and give information respecting their doctrines.
Zeal for conversion had certainly more share in the
matter than curiosity about the unknown. A young
Karaite, Samuel ben Aaron, who had settled at
Poswol in Samogitia, and understood some Latin,
resolved to make a journey to Riga, and hold a
conference with John Puffendorf, a royal official.
Through want of literary sources and the ignorance
of the Karaites concerning the origin and development
of their sect, Samuel ben Aaron could give
only a scanty account in a work, the title of which
proves that fancifulness had penetrated also to
Karaite circles.</p>

<p>From another side the Karaites were the object
of eager inquiry. A professor at Leyden, Jacob
Trigland, fairly well acquainted with Hebrew literature,
who intended to write a book about the old
Jewish sects, no longer in existence, had his attention
directed to the still existing Karaites. Inspired
by the wish to get information concerning the Polish
Karaites and obtain possession of their writings, he
sent a letter with various questions through well-known
mercantile houses to Karaites, to which he
solicited an answer. This letter accidentally fell
into the hands of a Karaite, Mordecai ben Nissan,
at Luzk, a poor official of the community, who did
not know enough to give the desired information as
to the beginning and cause of the schism between
Rabbanites and Karaites. He regarded it as a<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_184" id="Page_184">184</a></span>
point of honor to avail himself of this opportunity
to bring the forgotten Karaites to the remembrance
of the educated world through the instrumentality
of a Christian writer, and to deal blows at their
opponents, the Rabbanite Jews. He spared no
sacrifice to procure the few books by which he might
be able to instruct himself and his correspondent
Trigland. These materials, however, were not worth
much, and Mordecai's dissertation for Trigland
proved unsatisfactory, but for want of a better work
it had the good fortune to serve during nearly a
century and a half as the only source for the history
of Karaism. Some years later, when Charles XII,
the hero of the north, conquered Poland in his victorious
career, and like his father was anxious to have
more precise intelligence respecting Karaites, he
also made inquiries concerning them. Mordecai
ben Nissan used this occasion to compose a work in
Hebrew for Charles XII, in which he freely indulged
his hatred against Rabbanites, and strained every
nerve to make Talmudical literature ridiculous.</p>

<p>The zealous attention paid by Christian scholars
to Jewish literature could not fail to cause annoyance
and inconvenience to Jews. They felt sorely burdened
by German Protestant literati, who, acquiring
cumbersome learning, strove to rival the Dutch
writers and Richard Simon in France, without possessing
their mild and gentle toleration towards
Jews, or their elegance of style. Almost at the same
time three German Hebraists, W√ºlfer, Wagenseil,
and Eisenmenger, used their knowledge of Hebrew
literature to bring accusations against the Jews. All
three associated much with Jews, learned from them,
and devoted much study to Jewish literature, mastering
it to a certain degree.</p>

<p>John W√ºlfer of Nuremberg, who was educated for
the church, and had studied with a Jew of F√ºrth and
afterwards in Italy, thoroughly acquainting himself
with biblical and Talmudical literature, sought after<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_185" id="Page_185">185</a></span>
Hebrew manuscripts and old Jewish prayer-books
to found an accusation against the Jews. Christians,
instigated by baptized Jews, took offense at a beautiful
prayer (Alenu), which arose in a time and
country in which Christianity was little known.
Some Jews were wont to add a sentence to this
prayer: "For they (the heathen) pray unto vanity
and emptiness." In the word "emptiness," enemies
of the Jews pretended to see an allusion to Jesus
and to find blasphemy against him. The sentence
was not printed in the prayer-books, but in many
copies a blank space was left for it. This vacant
space, or the presence of the obnoxious word,
equally enraged the Protestants, and W√ºlfer, therefore,
searched libraries to find authority for it, and
when he found the word in manuscripts, he did not
fail to publish his discovery. He praised Prince
George of Hesse because he made his Jews swear
an oath never to utter a blasphemous word against
Jesus, and threatened to punish them with death in
case of transgression. W√ºlfer, on the other hand,
was candid enough to confess that the Jews had
been long and cruelly persecuted by Christians, that
the accusation against them of using blood was a
mischievous invention, and that the testimony of
baptized Jews deserved little credence.</p>

<p>John Christopher Wagenseil, a lawyer and professor
at Altorf, was a good-hearted man, and kindly
disposed towards the Jews. He had traveled
farther than W√ºlfer, had penetrated through Spain
into Africa, and took the greatest pains to hunt up
such Jewish writings as attacked Christianity from
the ground of Holy Scripture or with the weapons
of reason. His discoveries filled his quiver "with
the fiery darts of Satan." Wagenseil looked up
that insipid compilation of the magical miracles of
Jesus (Toldoth Jesho), with which a Jew, who had
been persecuted by Christians, tried to revenge
himself on the founder of Christianity, and he spent<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_186" id="Page_186">186</a></span>
much money in hunting up this Hebrew parody of
the Gospel. Few Jews possessed copies of it, and
the owners kept them under lock and key for their
own security. Because one Jew had once written
these absurdities about Jesus, and some Jews had
copies of the book in their possession, while others
had defended themselves against attacks by Christians,
Wagenseil felt assured that the Jews of his
time were vile blasphemers of Jesus. He therefore
implored the princes and civil magistrates to forbid
the Jews most strictly to continue such blasphemy.
He directed a pamphlet, "The Christian Denunciation,"
to all high potentates, urging them to impose
a formal oath upon Jews, not to utter any word of
mockery against Jesus, Mary, the cross, the mass,
and other Christian sacraments. Wagenseil had
two pious wishes besides. One was that the Protestant
princes should take active steps for the conversion
of the Jews. He had, it is true, convinced
himself that at Rome, where since the time of Pope
Gregory XIII a Dominican monk was wont on certain
Sabbaths to hold forth, in a sleepy manner, before
a number of Jews, they either ignored him or
mocked at him. But he thought that the Protestant
princes, more zealous Christians than the Catholics,
ought to devise a better plan. It also grieved this
thorough scholar that the colleges of rabbis presumed
to criticise writings concerning the Jewish
religion, and that they ventured to express their approval
or disapproval; this was an infringement of
the rights and the dignity of Christians! Withal
Wagenseil, as has been said, was kindly disposed
to the Jews. He remarked with emphasis that he
thought it wrong and unworthy to burn Jews, to rob
them of all their property, or to drive them with their
wives and children out of the country. It was excessively
cruel that in Germany and other countries
children of Jews should be baptized against the will
of their parents, and compelled to accept Christianity.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_187" id="Page_187">187</a></span>
The oppressions and insults to which they were
exposed at the hands of the Christian rabble were
by no means to be approved. It was not right that
they were compelled to say "Christ is risen," that
they were assailed with blows, had dirt and stones
thrown at them, and were not allowed to go about
in safety. Wagenseil wrote a pamphlet to expose
the horrible falsehood of the charge, that the Jews
use the blood of Christians. For the sake of this
pamphlet, which spoke so warmly for the Jews, his
other absurdities should be pardoned. Wagenseil
expressed his indignation at the horrible lie:</p>

<blockquote>

<p>"It might pass if the matter stopped with idle gossip; but that on
account of this execrable falsehood Jews have been tormented, punished,
and executed by thousands, should have moved even stones to
compassion, and made them cry out."</p></blockquote>

<p>Is it credible that in the face of this judgment,
spoken with firm conviction by W√ºlfer and Wagenseil,
who not only had associated with Jews for
years, but were accurately acquainted with Jewish
literature, and had penetrated into its innermost recesses
as none before them, their contemporaries
should seriously revive the horrible falsehood, and
justify it with ostentatious learning? A Protestant,
John Andrew Eisenmenger, professor of Oriental
languages, repeated the accusation, a thousand times
branded as false, and furnished posterity with abundant
material for charges against the Jews. Eisenmenger
belonged to the class of insects which sucks
poison even out of flowers. In confidential converse
with Jews, pretending that he desired to be converted
to Judaism, and in the profound study of
their literature, which he learned from them, he
sought only the dark side of both.</p>

<p>He compiled a venomous book in two volumes,
the title of which in itself was an invitation to Christians
to massacre the Jews, and was synonymous
with a repetition of earlier scenes of horror for the
Jews.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_188" id="Page_188">188</a></span></p>

<blockquote>

<p>"Judaism Unmasked; or a Thorough and True Account of the
Way in which the Stubborn Jews frightfully blaspheme and dishonor
the Holy Trinity, revile the Holy Mother of Christ, mockingly criticise
the New Testament, the Evangelists, the Apostles, and the Christian
Religion, and despise and curse to the Uttermost Extreme the whole
of Christianity. Much else besides, either not at all or very little
known, and Gross Errors of the Jewish Religion and Theology, as
well as Ridiculous and Amusing Stories, herein appear. All proved
from their own Books. Written for the Honest Information of all
Christians."</p></blockquote>

<p>Eisenmenger intended to hurl Wagenseil's "fiery
darts of Satan" with deadly aim at the Jews. If he
had merely quoted detached sentences from the
Talmudical and later Rabbinical literature and anti-Christian
writings, translated them, and drawn conclusions
from them hostile to the Jews, he would
only have proved his mental weakness. But Eisenmenger
represented most horrible falsehoods, as
Wagenseil had called them, as indisputable facts.
He adduced a whole chapter of proofs showing that
it was not lawful for Jews to save a Christian from
danger to life, that the Rabbinical laws command
the slaughter of Christians, and that no confidence
should be placed in Jewish physicians, nor ought
their medicines to be taken. He repeated all the
false stories of murders committed by Jews against
Christians, of the poisoning of wells by Jews at the
time of the Black Death, of the poisoning of the
elector of Brandenburg, Joachim II, by his Jewish
mint-master, of Raphael Levi's child-murder at Metz&mdash;in
short, all ever invented by saintly simplicity,
priestly fraud, or excited fanaticism, and imputed to
Jews. That the martyrdom of little Simon of Trent
was a fabrication had been clearly proved by the
doge and senate of Venice on authentic documents.
Not only the Jewish writers Isaac Viva and Isaac
Cardoso, but also Christians, like W√ºlfer and Wagenseil,
recognized these documents as genuine, and
represented the charge against the Jews of Trent
as a crying injustice. Eisenmenger was not influenced
by that, declared the documents to be forged,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_189" id="Page_189">189</a></span>
and maintained the bloodthirstiness of Jews with
fiery zeal and energy. One would be justified in
ascribing his proceedings against Jews to brutality
or avarice. Although very learned in Hebrew, he
was otherwise uncultured. He was willing to be
bribed by solid coin into silence with regard to the
Jews. But for the honor of humanity one would
rather impute his course to blindness; he had lived
a long time at Frankfort-on-the-Main, formerly the
center of hatred to Jews in Germany, and he may
there have imbibed his bitter animosity, and have
wished, at first from conscientious motives, to blacken
the character of the Jews.</p>

<p>Some Jews had got wind of the printing of
Eisenmenger's work at Frankfort, and were not a little
alarmed at the danger threatening them. The old
prejudices of the masses and the ecclesiastics against
Jews, stronger amongst Protestants than Catholics,
still existed too strongly for a firebrand publication
to appear in German without doing mischief wherever
it came. The Jews of Frankfort therefore
placed themselves in communication with the court-Jews
at Vienna in order to meet the danger.
Emperor Leopold I, who, at the instigation of the
empress and her father-confessor, had expelled the
Jews from Vienna, being in need of money in consequence
of the Turkish wars, fifteen years later
allowed some rich Jews to settle in the capital.
Samuel Oppenheim, of Heidelberg, a banker, one of
the noblest of Jews, whose heart and hand were
open to all sufferers, had probably brought about
this concession. As before, several Jewish families,
alleged to be his servants, came with him to Vienna.
Samuel Oppenheim zealously endeavored to prevent
the circulation of Eisenmenger's book against
the Jews. He had the same year experienced what
a Christian rabble instigated by hatred of Jews
could do. A riotous assault was made upon his
house, which was broken into, and everything<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_190" id="Page_190">190</a></span>
there, including the money-chest, was plundered
(July 17, 1700). Hence from personal motives
and on public grounds Samuel Oppenheim exerted
himself to prevent the 2,000 copies of Eisenmenger's
work from seeing the light of day. He
and other Jews could justly maintain that the publication
of this book in German, unattractive though
its style was, would lead to the massacre of the Jews.
An edict was therefore issued by the emperor forbidding
its dissemination. Eisenmenger was doubly
disappointed; he could not wreak his hatred on the
Jews, and he had lost the whole of his property,
which he had spent on the printing, and was obliged
to incur debts. All the copies, except a few which
he had abstracted, were in Frankfort under lock
and key. He entered into negotiations with Jews,
and proposed to destroy his work for 90,000 marks.
As the Jews offered scarcely half that sum, the confiscation
remained in force, and Eisenmenger, deceived
in all his hopes, died of vexation.</p>

<p>But the matter did not terminate there. Frederick I,
the newly-crowned king of Prussia, took a
lively interest in the book. The attention of this
prince was keenly directed to the Jews from various
causes. At the beginning of the eighteenth century
more than a thousand Jews dwelt in his domains.
The community of Berlin had grown in thirty years,
since their admission, from twelve to some seventy
families. Frederick I, who was fond of show and
pomp, had no particular partiality for Jews, but he
valued them for the income derived from them.
The court jeweler, Jost Liebmann, was highly
esteemed at court, because he supplied pearls and
trinkets on credit, and thus held an exceptionally
favorable position. It was said that Liebmann's
wife had taken the fancy of the prince; she later
obtained the liberty of entering the king's apartment
unannounced. Through her the Jews received permission
to have a cemetery in K√∂nigsberg; but<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_191" id="Page_191">191</a></span>
Jewish money was more highly prized by this king
than Jewish favorites. Frederick, who while elector
had thought of banishing the Jews, tolerated them
for the safety tax which they had to pay&mdash;100 ducats
yearly&mdash;but they were subjected to severe restrictions,
amongst others they could not own houses
and lands. Yet they were allowed to have synagogues,
first a private one granted as a favor to the
court jeweler Jost Liebmann and the family of
David Riess, an immigrant from Austria, and then,
owing to frequent disputes about rights and privileges,
a public synagogue as well.</p>

<p>Two maliciously disposed baptized Jews, Christian Kahtz
and Francis Wenzel, sought to prejudice
the new king and the population against the
Jews. "Blasphemy against Jesus"&mdash;so runs the
lying charge. The prayer "Alenu" and others were
cited as proofs that the Jews pronounced the name
of Jesus with contumely, and that they spat in doing
so. The guilds not being well disposed to the
Jews utilized this excitement for fanatical persecution,
and such bitter feeling arose in the cities
and villages against the Jews, that (as they expressed
themselves, perhaps knowingly exaggerating) their
life was no longer safe. King Frederick proposed
a course which does honor to his good heart. He
issued a command (December, 1700) to all the presidents
of departments to call together the rabbis
and, in default of them, the Jewish school-masters
and elders on a certain day, and ask them on oath
whether, in uttering or silently using the blasphemous
word "va-rik," they applied it to Jesus. The Jews
everywhere solemnly declared on oath that they did
not refer to Jesus in this prayer at the place where
the lacuna was left in the prayer-books. John
Henry Michaelis, the theologian, of Halle, who was
asked respecting the character of the Jews, pronounced
them innocent of the blasphemy of which
they were accused. As the king continued to suspect<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_192" id="Page_192">192</a></span>
the Jews of reviling Jesus in thought, he issued
orders characteristic of the time (1703). He said
that it was his heart's wish to bring the people of
Israel, whom the Lord had once loved and chosen
as His peculiar possession, into the Christian communion.
He did not, however, presume to exercise
control over their consciences, but would leave the
conversion of the Jews to time and God's wise counsel.
Nor would he bind them by oath to refrain
from uttering in prayer the words in question. But he
commanded them on pain of punishment to refrain
from those words, to utter the prayer "Alenu" aloud,
and not to spit while so doing. Spies were appointed
to visit the synagogues from time to time,
as eleven centuries before in the Byzantine empire,
in order to observe whether this concluding prayer
was pronounced aloud or in a whisper.</p>

<p>Eisenmenger before his death, and his heirs after
him, knowing that the king of Prussia was inclined
to listen to accusations against the Jews, had applied
to him to entreat Emperor Leopold to release the
book against the Jews, entitled "Judaism Unmasked,"
from ban and prohibition. Frederick I interested
himself warmly in the matter, and sent a kind of
petition to Emperor Leopold I (April 25, 1705)
very characteristic of the tone of that time. The
king represented that Eisenmenger had sunk all his
money in this book, and had died of vexation at the
imperial prohibition. It would seem a lowering of
Christianity if the Jews were so powerful as to be
able to suppress a book written in defense of Christianity
and in refutation of Jewish errors. There
was no reason to apprehend, as the Jews pretended,
that it would incite the people to a violent onslaught
against them, since similar writings had lately appeared
which had done them no harm. Eisenmenger's
book aimed chiefly at the promotion of
Christianity, so that Christians might not, as had
repeatedly happened some years ago, be induced to<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_193" id="Page_193">193</a></span>
revolt from it and become adherents of Judaism.
But Emperor Leopold would not remove the ban
from Eisenmenger's book. King Frederick repeated
his request three years later, at the desire of Eisenmenger's
heirs, to Emperor Joseph I. With him
also King Frederick found no favorable hearing,
and the 2,000 copies of "Judaism Unmasked"
remained at Frankfort under ban for forty years.
But with Frederick's approval a second edition was
brought out at K√∂nigsberg, where the imperial censorship
had no power. For the moment it had no
such effect as the one side had hoped and the other
feared; but, later on, when the rights of Jews as
men and citizens were considered, it proved an
armory for malicious or indolent opponents.</p>

<p>King Frederick I was often urged by enemies of
the Jews to make his royal authority a cloak for their
villainy. The bright and the dark side of the general
appreciation of Jewish literature appeared
clearly. In Holland, likewise a Protestant country,
a Christian scholar of this period cherished great
enthusiasm for the Mishna, the backbone of Talmudical
Judaism. William Surenhuysius, a young man
of Amsterdam, in the course of many years translated
the Mishna with two commentaries upon it into
Latin (printed 1698&ndash;1703). He displayed more than
the usual amount of Dutch industry and application.
Love certainly was needed to undertake such a
study, persevere in it, and finish the work in a clear
and attractive style. No language and literature
present so many difficulties as this dialect, now
almost obsolete, the objects which it describes, and
the form in which it is cast. Surenhuysius sat at
the feet of Jewish teachers, of whom there were
many at Amsterdam, and he was extremely grateful
for their help. But their assistance did not enable
him to dispense with industry and devotion. He
was influenced by the conviction that the oral Law,
the Mishna, in its main contents is as divine as the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_194" id="Page_194">194</a></span>
written word of the Bible. He desired that Christian
youths in training for theology and the clerical
profession should not yield to the seductions of
classical literature, but by engaging in the study of
the Mishna should, as it were, receive ordination
beforehand.</p>

<blockquote>

<p>"He who desires to be a good and worthy disciple of Christ must
first become a Jew, or he must first learn thoroughly the language and
culture of the Jews, and become Moses's disciple before he joins
the Apostles, in order that he may be able through Moses and the
prophets to convince men that Jesus is the Messiah."</p></blockquote>

<p>In this enthusiastic admiration for the corner-stone
of the edifice of Judaism, which the builders up of
culture were wont to despise, Surenhuysius included
the people who owned these laws. He cordially
thanked the senate of Amsterdam because it specially
protected the Jews.</p>

<blockquote>

<p>"In the measure in which this people once surpassed all other
peoples, you give it preference, worthy men! The old renown and
dignity, which this people and the citizens of Jerusalem once possessed,
are yours. For the Jews are sincerely devoted to you, not
overcome by force of arms, but won over by humanity and wisdom;
they come to you, and are happy to obey your republican government."</p></blockquote>

<p>Surenhuysius was outspoken in his displeasure
against those who having learned what served their
interest from the Scriptures of the Jews, reviled and
threw mud at them, "like highwaymen, who, having
robbed an honest man of all his clothes, beat him to
death, and send him away with scorn." He formed
a plan to make the whole of Rabbinical literature
accessible to the learned world through the Latin
language. While Surenhuysius of Amsterdam felt
such enthusiasm for this, not the most brilliant, side
of Judaism, and saw in it a means to promote
Christianity (in which view he did not stand alone),
a vile Polish Jew, named Aaron Margalita, an
apostate to Christianity for the sake of gain, brought
fresh accusations of blasphemy before King Frederick
of Prussia against an utterly harmless part of
Jewish literature&mdash;the old Agada. An edition of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_195" id="Page_195">195</a></span>
the Midrash Rabba (1705), published at Frankfort-on-the-Oder,
was accordingly put under a ban by
the king's command, until Christian theologians
should pronounce judgment upon it.</p>

<p>The best result of this taste for Jewish literature
on the part of learned Christians, and of the literary
works promoted thereby was an interesting historical
work concerning Jews and Judaism, which may
be said to have terminated the old, and foreshadowed
a new epoch. Jacob Basnage (born 1653, died
1723), of noble character, a Protestant theologian, a
solid historian, a pleasant author, and a person held
in high esteem generally, rendered incalculable service
to Judaism. He sifted the results of the laborious
researches of scholars, popularized them, and
made them accessible to all educated circles. In
his assiduous historical inquiries, especially as to the
development of the Church, Basnage met Jews at
almost every step. He had a suspicion that the
Jewish people had not, as ordinary theologians
thought, become utterly bankrupt through the loss
of its political independence and the spread of Christianity,
a doomed victim, the ghost of its former self.
The great sufferings of this people and its rich literature
inspired him with awe. His sense of truth
with regard to historical events would not allow him
to dismiss facts or explain them away with empty
phrases. Basnage undertook to compile the history
of the Jews or the Jewish religion, so far as it was
known to him, from Jesus down to his own times.
He labored on this work for more than five years.
It was intended to continue the history of the Jewish
historian Flavius Josephus after the dispersion of
the Jewish people. Basnage strove, as far as was
possible for a staunch Protestant at that time, to
present and judge events in an impartial manner.</p>

<blockquote>

<p>"Christians may not be surprised that we often acquit the Jews of
crimes of which they are not guilty, since justice so requires. No partiality
is implied in accusing those of injustice and oppression who<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_196" id="Page_196">196</a></span>
have been guilty of them. We have no intention to injure the Jews
any more than to flatter them.... In the decay and dregs of centuries
men have adopted a spirit of cruelty and barbarism towards the
Jews. They were accused of being the cause of all the disasters which
happened, and charged with a multitude of crimes of which they
never even dreamed. Numberless miracles were invented to convict
them, or rather the better to satisfy hatred under the shade of religion.
We have made a collection of laws, which councils and princes published
against them, by means of which people can judge of the malice
of the former and the oppression of the latter. Men did not, however,
confine themselves to the edicts, but everywhere military executions,
popular riots, and massacres took place. Yet, by a miracle of Providence,
which must excite the astonishment of all Christians, this hated
nation, persecuted in all places for a great number of centuries, still
exists everywhere.... Peoples and kings, heathens, Christians, and
Mahometans, opposed to one another in so many points, have agreed
in the purpose of destroying this nation, and have not succeeded.
The bush of Moses, surrounded by flames, has ever burned without
being consumed. The Jews have been driven out of all the cities of
the world, and this has only served to spread them abroad in all cities.
They still live in spite of the contempt and hatred which follow them
everywhere, while the greatest monarchies have fallen, and are known
to us only by name."</p></blockquote>

<p>Basnage, who by the revocation of the Edict of
Nantes through the Catholic intolerance of Louis
XIV was banished to Holland, could to some degree
appreciate the feelings of the Jews during their long
exile. He had acquired sufficient knowledge of
Jewish literature to consult the authorities in the
execution of his work. The historical works of
Abraham ibn Daud, Ibn Yachya, Ibn Verga, David
Gans, and others were not neglected; they served
Basnage as building material wherewith to rear the
great fabric of Jewish history of the sixteen centuries
since the origin of Christianity.</p>

<p>But Basnage was not sufficiently an artist to unroll
before the eye in glowing colors, even if in images
fleeting as the mist, the sublime or tragic scenes
of Jewish history. Nor had he the talent to mass
together or marshal in groups and detachments facts
widely scattered in consequence of the peculiar
course of this people's history. One can feel in
Basnage's presentation that he was oppressed and
overpowered by the superabundance of details. He
jumbled together times and occurrences in motley<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_197" id="Page_197">197</a></span>
confusion, divided the history into two unnatural
halves, the East and the West, and described in conjunction
events without connection. Of the deep
inner springs of the life and deeds of the nation he
had no comprehension. His Protestant creed hindered
him; he saw Jewish history only through the
thick mist of Church history. Despite his efforts to
be impartial and honest, he could not rid himself of
the belief that the "Jews are rejected because they
have rejected Jesus." In short, Basnage's "History
of the Religion of the Jews" has a thousand faults.
Hardly a single sentence can be regarded as perfectly
just and in accordance with the truth.</p>

<p>Yet the appearance of this work was of great importance
to the Jews. It circulated in the educated
world a mass of historical information, crude and
distorted though it was, because it was written in
the fashionable French language, and this seed shot
up everywhere luxuriantly. A people, which, despite
bloody persecutions, without a home, with no spot
on the whole earth where it could lay its head or
place its foot, yet possessed a history not wholly devoid
of splendor&mdash;such a people was not like a gipsy
horde, but must find ever-increasing consideration.
Without his knowledge or intention, even whilst
casting many an aspersion upon the Jewish race,
Basnage paved the way to raising it from its abject
condition. Christian Theophilus Unger, a pastor in
Silesia, and John Christopher Wolf, professor of
Oriental languages in Hamburg, who were busily
and earnestly engaged in the study of Jewish literature
and history, became Basnage's disciples, and
without his work could not have effected so much as
they did in this field. Both, especially Wolf, filled
many gaps which Basnage had left, and evinced a
certain degree of warmth for the cause.</p>

<p>The admiration, or at least sympathy, felt for the
Jews at this time, induced John Toland (an Irishman,
the courageous opponent of fossilized Christianity)<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_198" id="Page_198">198</a></span>
to raise his voice on behalf of their equality
with Christians in England and Ireland. This was
the first word spoken in favor of their emancipation.
But the people, in whose favor this remarkable revulsion
of sentiment had taken place in the educated
world, was without knowledge of it, and felt no change
in popular sentiment.</p>

<p class="center b2">1700&ndash;1725 <span class="smcap smaller">C. E.</span></p>

<p>At the time when the eyes of the civilized world
were directed upon the Jewish race with a certain
degree of sympathy and admiration, and when, at
the dawn of enlightenment in the so-called philosophical
century, ecclesiastical prejudices were beginning
to disappear, the members of this race were
making a by no means favorable impression upon
those with whom they came into contact. Weighed
in the balance, they were found wanting even by
their well-wishers. The Jews were at no time in so
pitiful a plight as at the end of the seventeenth and
beginning of the eighteenth century. Several circumstances
had contributed to render them utterly
demoralized and despised. The former teachers
of Europe, through the sad course of centuries, had
become childish, or worse, dotards. Every public
or historical act of the Jews bears this character of
imbecility, if not contemptibility. There was not a
single cheering event, hardly a person commanding
respect who could worthily represent Judaism, and
bring it into estimation. The strong-minded, manly
Orobio de Castro (died in 1687), the former victim<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_200" id="Page_200">200</a></span>
of the Inquisition, whose fidelity to conviction, whose
dignity, and the acumen with which he contested
Christianity commanded the respect of the leading
opponents of Judaism, was indeed still living. But
he left no successor of equal standing within the
highly cultured community of Amsterdam, certainly
not outside of it, where the conditions for an independent
Jewish personality possessed of culture
were entirely wanting. The leaders of the community
were for the most part led astray, wandering
as in a dream, and stumbling at every step. But
few rabbis occupied themselves with any branch of
knowledge beyond the Talmud, or entered on a new
path in this study. The exceptions can be counted.
Rabbi David Nieto, of London (born 1654, died
1728), was a man of culture. He was a physician,
understood mathematics, was sufficiently able to defend
Judaism against calumnies, and, besides many
platitudes, wrote much that was reasonable. The
Italian rabbi, Jehuda Leon Brieli, of Mantua (born
about 1643, died 1722), was also an important personage&mdash;a
man of sound views, of solid, even philosophical
knowledge, whose style in the vernacular
was elegant, and who knew how to defend Judaism
against Christian aggressiveness. Brieli had the
courage to disregard two customs, which was accounted
worse than criminal by his contemporaries:
he remained unmarried all his life, and though a
rabbi, did not wear a beard. But Brieli's influence
on his Jewish contemporaries was very slight. He
knew the weaknesses of Christianity, but had not
the same sharp vision for the faults of Judaism and
the Jews. Of the mischievous nature of the Zohar
and the Kabbala generally, however, Brieli was
thoroughly aware; he wished that they had not seen
the light of day; but his critical knowledge extended
no further.</p>

<p>For the rest, the rabbis of this period were not
models, the Poles and Germans being for the most<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_201" id="Page_201">201</a></span>
part pitiable figures, their heads filled with unprofitable
knowledge, otherwise ignorant and helpless as
little children. The Portuguese rabbis presented a
dignified, imposing appearance, but they were
shallow. The Italians bore more resemblance to
the Germans, but had not their learning. Thus,
with no guides acquainted with the road, sunk in ignorance,
or filled with conceit, beset with phantoms,
the Jews in all parts of the world without exception
were passing from one absurdity to another, and
allowing themselves to be imposed upon by jugglers
and visionaries. Any absurdity, however transparent,
provided it was apparently vindicated with
religious earnestness, and interlarded with strained
verses of Scripture, or sayings from the Talmud
artificially explained, or garnished with scraps of
the Kabbala, was persistently believed and propagated.
"The minds of men, estranged from life
and true knowledge, exhausted their powers in
subtleties and the superstitious errors of the Kabbala.
Teachers spoke seldom or only in the words
of the Talmud to their scholars; no attention was
paid to delivery, for there was no language and no
eloquence." The culminating point of the Middle
Ages was reached in Jewish history at a time when
it had been passed by the most of Western Europe.
The spread of superstitious usages with a coating
of religion was in no wise checked. To write
amulets (Kamea) for the exorcism of diseases was
required of the rabbis, and they devoted themselves
to this work; many wished to be thought conjurors
of spirits. A rabbi, Simon Baki at Casale in Italy,
complained to his master, the foolish Kabbalist
Moses Zacut at Venice, that he had used the prescribed
formulas of conjuration for a woman at Turin
supposed to be possessed, without any successful
result. Thereupon the latter gave him more efficacious
means, viz., whilst using God's name in
prayer, he was to hold burning sulphur to the nose<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_202" id="Page_202">202</a></span>
of the possessed. The more sensitive she was, and
the more she struggled against the remedy, the
more might he be convinced that she was possessed
by an evil spirit. An instructed Jew of the Kabbalist
school of Damascus once boasted seriously
before the free-thinking critic Richard Simon, that
he could evoke a genius of a high order, and began
to make preparations. The incredulous Father
followed his movements with a satirical smile, and
the conjuror got out of the predicament with the
remark that the soil of France was not suited for
apparitions.</p>

<p>To elevate Judaism in the eyes of the nations and
to represent it in a manner worthy of respect was
at this time not in the power of the Jews. They
rather degraded and made it contemptible. Thoughtful
Christians stood astonished before this wonderful
monument of history, this people with its learning
and its alternately glorious and tragic destiny; but
its own sons were too dull to feel their own greatness,
or sought it only in silly stories and absurd
actions. Whilst Christians industriously and with
feelings of amazement investigated the history of
the Jews during three thousand years, the Jews had
no such feeling, not even the cultivated Portuguese
Jews. Manasseh ben Israel had outlined a history
of the Jews, and probably suggested Basnage's
work, but he did not accomplish his own design.
Three historians, indeed, are named as belonging
to this time&mdash;the itinerant rabbi David Conforte,
secondly, Miguel (Daniel) de Barrios, a Marrano,
born in Portugal, who returned to Judaism at
Amsterdam, and lastly the Polish rabbi Jechiel
Heilperin, of Minsk. But all three resemble the
monkish chroniclers of the barbarous ages, and their
style is more repulsive than attractive.</p>

<p>If literature is the true photograph of the thoughts
and aspirations of an age, then the century between
Spinoza and Mendelssohn, judged by its literary<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_203" id="Page_203">203</a></span>
productions, must have had very ugly features. A
good deal, it is true, was written and published;
every rabbi by a fresh contribution to the already
stupendous pile of Rabbinical matter essayed to
perpetuate his name, to secure his future bliss, and
withal to earn a pittance. Subtle Rabbinical commentaries,
insipid sermons, and books of devotion,
acrimonious controversial writings were the emanations
of the Jewish mind or lack of mind at this time.
The flower of poetry found no soil in this quagmire.
This age produced only two Jewish poets, genuine
sons of the Jewish muse, who lived at a great distance
from each other, one in the island of Jamaica,
the other in Italy&mdash;Lopez Laguna and Luzzatto&mdash;as
if the old Jewish trunk, crownless and leafless,
wished to reveal the life at its heart and prove its
capability to renew its youth even under the most
unfavorable circumstances. Lopez Laguna, born a
Marrano in France (about 1660, died after 1720),
came when but a youth to Spain, where he made the
acquaintance of the horrible Inquisition. In his
night of suffering, the Psalms, full of tender feeling,
brought light and hope to him as to so many of his
companions in sorrow. Released from prison, and
having escaped to Jamaica, Laguna, under the Jewish
name of Daniel Israel, attuned his harp to the
holy songs which had revived his soul. To make
the Psalms accessible to others, especially to Marranos
ignorant of Hebrew, he made a faithful translation
of them into melodious, elegant Spanish verse.
This psalter, "a mirror of life," Daniel Israel Lopez
Laguna took to London, where his work procured
him a triumphant reception from several minor
poets and also from three Jewish poetesses, Sarah
de Fonseca Pinto y Pimentel, Manuela Nu√±ez da
Almeida, and Bienvenida Coen Belmonte, who
addressed him in Latin, English, Portuguese, and
Spanish verses.</p>

<p>Moses Chayim Luzzatto, a victim to the dreary<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_204" id="Page_204">204</a></span>
errors of this time, composed two Hebrew dramas
full of beauty and youthful freshness. With the exception
of these poetical flowers this long period
shows a colorless waste. Daniel de Barrios, captain,
historian, and beggar, cannot be reckoned a
poet, although he composed an astonishing number
of Spanish, as well as Hebrew rhymes, besides several
Spanish dramas, and he sang before, and without
shame begged of, nearly every Jewish and Christian
magnate who possessed a full purse.</p>

<p>Not only the scientific and artistic spirit, but also
the moral sense was lost, or at least blunted in this
general demoralization. The fundamental virtues
of the Jewish race continued to exist even at this
time in undiminished strength&mdash;idyllic family love,
brotherly sympathy towards one another, and chastity.
Gross vices and crimes occurred even then
but seldom in the tents of Jacob. Thoroughly corrupt
outcasts were considerate enough to leave it,
and to pollute the church or the mosque with their
immorality. But the feeling of right and honor
amongst Jews was on the whole weakened. There
was a lowering in tone of that tender conscience,
which with a sort of maiden shame avoids even what
the precepts of religion and the paragraphs of the
civil code leave unforbidden. To make money was
so imperious a necessity that ways and means
became indifferent, and were not exposed to censure.
To take undue advantage, and to overreach, not
merely a hostile population, but even their own co-religionists,
was regarded for the most part not as
a disgrace, but rather as a kind of heroic action.
From this sprang worship of Mammon, not merely
love, but also respect for gold, no matter how impure
its source. The democratic equality hitherto maintained
amongst Jews, who refused to recognize distinctions
of class and caste, was lost in the furious
dance round the golden calf. The rich man was
held worthy of honor&mdash;one to whom those less<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_205" id="Page_205">205</a></span>
kindly favored by fortune looked up as to something
higher, and in whom they therefore overlooked
many failings. The richest, not the most worthy,
were made the managers of the community, and
were granted a charter for arbitrary conduct
and arrogance. A satire of the period scourges
very severely the almighty power of money, to which
all bowed down. "The dollar binds and looses,
it raises the ignorant to the chief offices in the
community."</p>

<p>Increasing poverty among Jews was partly the
cause of this state of affairs. Only among the small
number of Portuguese Jews at Amsterdam, Hamburg,
Leghorn, Florence, and London, there were
men of considerable wealth. Isaac (Antonio)
Suasso, created Baron Alvernes de Gras by Charles
II, of Spain, was able to advance to William III, for
his semi-adventurous expedition to London to obtain
the English crown, two million florins without
interest, with the simple words, "If you are fortunate,
you will repay them to me; if not, I am willing
to lose them." The millionaires at Amsterdam
were the Pintos, the Belmontes, David Bueno de
Mesquito, Francisco Melo, who rendered many
services to Holland by his wealth. One of the De
Pintos bequeathed several millions for noble objects,
making provision for Jewish communities, the state,
Christian orphanages, clergy, clerks, and sextons.
At Hamburg there were the Texeiras, who were related
by marriage to Suasso, and Daniel Abensur,
able to make large advances to the poor rulers of
Poland. On the other hand, the Polish, German,
and also the Italian and the Oriental Jews, were extremely
impoverished. The changes which commerce
had experienced brought about this alteration.
The Jews could no longer practice usury, they had
no capital, or rather Christian capitalists competed
with them. Poorest of all were the Polish Jews,&mdash;they
who used to lord it over all the Jews in Europe.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_206" id="Page_206">206</a></span>
They could not recover from the wounds which the
Cossack disturbances had inflicted on them, and the
disruption of the Polish kingdom that followed
caused them fresh troubles. The increasing poverty
of the Polish Jews every year drove swarms of beggars
to the west and south of Europe. They resorted
to the large communities to procure shelter
and food from their rich brethren. Polish students
of the Talmud, superior to all other Jews in knowledge
of the Talmud, went principally to the important
rabbinates, Prague, Nikolsburg, Frankfort-on-the-Main,
Amsterdam, and Hamburg, and even to
Italian communities. Every Polish emigrant was,
or proclaimed himself to be, a rabbi or preacher, and
was so regarded. Many of them were a disgrace to
the rabbinical office, for which they had no qualifications,
either mental or moral. They fawned on the
rich from need and habit. From them sprang the
ever-increasing demoralization among Jews. To
their care, or rather to their neglect, were entrusted
the Jewish youth, who, as soon as they could talk,
were introduced to the Talmud, after the sophistical,
artificial method. Through this perversity the language
of the German Jews, like that of the Poles,
degenerated into a repulsive stammer, and their
manner of thinking and love of disputation into
crabbed dogmatism that defied all logic. Their feeling
for simplicity and truth was lost, and even the
Portuguese Jews, who kept themselves aloof from
the odious jargon, did not remain uncontaminated
by the perverse manner of thinking prevalent at the
time.</p>

<p>Added to this was the fact that the mud-streams
of Sabbatian fanaticism burst forth afresh. They
besmirched all who came in contact with them, but,
nevertheless, they were regarded as a pure stream
from the fountain-head of the Deity. Their one
good effect was that they stirred up, and set in motion
the stagnant swamp; or, to speak without metaphor,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_207" id="Page_207">207</a></span>
the sluggish routine in which the Jews lived
was broken, and the rabbis, dull with unfruitful learning,
were roused to a certain degree of passion and
energy. After Sabbata√Ø's death one of his followers,
Daniel Israel Bonafoux, an ignorant officiating
reader (Chazan) at Smyrna, kept up the faith in the
dead Messiah by all sorts of jugglery. At one time
he pretended to have seen a moving fire-ball; at
another, to have heard a voice say that Sabbata√Ø
was still alive, and would reign forever. The community
at Smyrna bribed the Kadi to banish him
from the city, but Daniel Israel took up his residence
in the neighborhood of Smyrna, and encouraged the
sect to persevere in its belief. He was aided and
abetted by Abraham Michael Cardoso of Tripoli,
who reappeared on this stage, where he found a conventicle
of Sabbatian associates, who flocked round
him, because with his scientific education, his culture,
and fluency of speech, he was far superior to them.
Cardoso announced dreams and visions, declared
himself Sabbata√Ø Zevi's successor, the Ephraimite
Messiah, practiced extraordinary impositions, and
visited graves to be inspired by departed spirits, and
obtain predictions to suit his theory. This consisted
in the blasphemous assumption that there are two
Gods&mdash;one the First Cause, incomprehensible, without
will and influence over the universe; the other
the God of Israel, the actual Creator of the world,
and Lawgiver of the Jewish people, who alone should
be worshiped. But the rabbis of Smyrna put a stop
to Cardoso's proceedings, threatened him with death,
and compelled him to leave Sabbata√Ø Zevi's birthplace.
He betook himself thence to Constantinople
with his Smyrna adherents, later pursued his mischievous
behavior at Adrianople, Rhodosto, in Egypt,
the Archipelago, and Candia; now as Messiah, now
as physician, composed numerous treatises on the
advent of the Messianic kingdom, expounded his
theosophical-dualistic theory, incurred debts, drew<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_208" id="Page_208">208</a></span>
women into his Kabbalistic conventicle, and is said
to have lived immorally even to old age. At last
Cardoso was stabbed by his nephew, who believed
that he had been cheated by him (1706). His imposture
did not cease with his death; for his writings,
a mixture of sense and nonsense, were eagerly
read, and inflamed men's minds. Abraham Michael
Cardoso remained at least faithful to Judaism, did
not reverence Sabbata√Ø Zevi as divine, vehemently
contended against this blasphemy, and did not go
over to Mahometanism. His prophet, Daniel Israel
Bonafoux, on the other hand, assumed the turban,
probably on account of the persecution suffered at
the hands of the rabbinate of Smyrna.</p>

<p>Far more important was the Kabbalistic fanaticism
spread by an itinerant Sabbatian preacher, and
transplanted to Poland, where it found congenial
soil, and maintained its ground tenaciously. Mordecai
of Eisenstadt (Mochiach), even after the death
of the renegade, remained his faithful follower. A
disciple of Nathan and partisan of Cardoso, he returned
to his home from the East, was of prepossessing
appearance and awe-inspiring features, lived an
ascetic life, fasted eleven days in succession, preached
in Hungary, Moravia, Bohemia, and Italy with much
impressiveness on penitence and contrition&mdash;in fact,
played the part of a Jewish Vincent Ferrer. The
applause which his preaching excited awakened his
confidence, and he gave himself out as a prophet.
In word and writing the preacher of Eisenstadt
maintained that Sabbata√Ø Zevi was the true Messiah,
obliged to become a Mussulman by high mystical
dispensation. The Hungarian, Moravian, and Bohemian
Jews listened to these Sabbatian preachings
and prophecies with eager interest. The Sabbatian
frenzy had so blunted their power of thought that
they were not offended at the notion of a new Messiah
who had apostatized from Judaism. Mordecai
went further in his folly, gave himself out as the true<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_209" id="Page_209">209</a></span>
Messiah of the house of David, and maintained that
he was Sabbata√Ø Zevi risen from the dead. The latter
had not been able to accomplish the work of redemption,
because he was rich. The Messiah must
be poor; therefore he, Mordecai, being poor and
persecuted, was the true redeemer. All this nonsense
was accepted with credulous devotion. Some
Italian Jews formally invited the Hungarian Messiah
to come to them, and he obeyed the summons. At
Modena and Reggio he was received with enthusiasm.
He talked of his mission&mdash;that he must go
to Rome in order to make Messianic preparations
in the sinful city. He cunningly hinted that he might
be obliged to assume a Christian disguise, as Sabbata√Ø
Zevi had been obliged to veil himself in Turkish
clothing: that is, in case of need he would apparently
submit to baptism. Some Jews appear to
have betrayed his plans to the Roman Inquisition,
and his Italian followers advised him to leave Italy.
He went once more to Bohemia, but could not find
a footing there, and emigrated to Poland. Here,
whither only a dim rumor of Sabbata√Ø and the Sabbatians
had penetrated, he found, it appears, numerous
followers; for a sect was formed there which
pursued its baneful career until the beginning of
the age of Mendelssohn, and even beyond that
period.</p>

<p>At the same time the old imposture reappeared
under new forms in Turkey. Sabbata√Ø Zevi had
left a widow, the daughter of Joseph Philosoph of
Salonica, a learned Talmudist. She is said either
from ambition or, as her enemies declared, from
licentious motives, to have led the Sabbatians into
fresh frenzy. Having returned to Salonica, she is
said to have passed off her brother, Jacob (surnamed
Querido, the favorite), as her son by Sabbata√Ø Zevi.
This boy, who received the name of Jacob Zevi, became
an object of devout reverence to the Sabbatians.
They believed that in him the united souls<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_210" id="Page_210">210</a></span>
of the two Messiahs of the houses of Joseph and
David were born again; he was therefore to be regarded
as the true redeemer, the genuine successor
of Sabbata√Ø. This new fantastic idea found the more
adherents because Querido's own father, Joseph
Philosoph, a man deeply versed in the Talmud, and
another learned Talmudist, Solomon Florentin,
joined the believers, and supported the new claimant.
The widow of the Messiah and her brother
Querido are said straightway to have recommended
and practiced sexual indulgence as a means of promoting
the work of redemption. The sinfulness of
the world, they maintained, could be overcome only
by a superabundance of sin, by the extremest degree
of licentiousness. Among these Salonica Sabbatians,
then, shameless profligacy, even incest, were
openly practiced&mdash;so their enemies declared. One
thing only is certain, marriage was not regarded as
sacred among these people. According to the perverse
teachings of the Luryan school of Kabbalists,
women who were not acceptable to their husbands,
being a hindrance to a harmonious mystical marriage,
could be divorced without further ceremony, and
made over to others, who felt themselves attracted
to them. This precept was only too eagerly obeyed
in the mystical circle. It was a peculiar sort of
"elective affinity." Several hundreds in Salonica
belonged to this Sabbatian sect, chiefly young
people. Amongst them was a young man named
Solomon Ayllon, afterwards rabbi in London and
Amsterdam, who shared in the prevailing loose life.
He married a wife, as the one appointed by heaven,
whom another man had forsaken without formal divorce,
and she was carried off from him by a third.
The Sabbatians of Salonica stood in close connection
with other members of the sect in Adrianople
and Smyrna.</p>

<p>The rabbis could not regard this disorder with
indifference, and denounced the offenders to the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_211" id="Page_211">211</a></span>
Turkish authorities. The latter instituted investigations,
and sentenced them to severe punishments.
But the Sabbatians had learned from their founder
a means of appeasing the anger of Turkish rulers.
They all, to the number of four hundred it is said,
assumed the white turban (about 1687), and displayed
more earnestness than Sabbata√Ø in their
newly-adopted faith. The pseudo-Messiah Jacob
Zevi Querido with many of his followers made a pilgrimage
to Mecca, in order to pray at the tomb of
the prophet Mahomet. On the journey back he
died at Alexandria. The leadership of the Turco-Jewish
sect at Salonica was afterwards undertaken
by his son Berachya, or Barochya (about 1695&ndash;1740).
He also was regarded as the successor of Sabbata√Ø
Zevi, as the embodiment of the original soul of the
Messiah, as the incarnate Deity. His followers
lived under the name Dolm√§h (properly Donm√§h),
that is, apostates from Judaism, a sect distinct alike
from Jews and Turks, who married only one another,
and attended the mosques now and then, but more
frequently assembled in secret for their own mystical
service, to worship their redeemer and man-God.
There are still in Salonica descendants of the sect
of Sabbata√Ø-Querido-Berachya, who observe a
mixture of Kabbalistic and Turkish usages. Of Judaism
they retained only circumcision on the eighth
day and the Song of Solomon, the love dialogues and
monologues of which left them free play for mystical
and licentious interpretations. Recently the sultan
granted the Donm√§h, now said to number 4,000
members, the free exercise of their religion.</p>

<p>In spite, perhaps on account of these excesses on
the part of the Sabbatians of Salonica, opposed
alike to Judaism and morality, they continually
found fresh supporters, who clung to the delusion
with pertinacity, deceived themselves and others,
and gave impostors an opportunity to profit by this
fanatical humor. From the East and from Poland<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_212" id="Page_212">212</a></span>
secret Sabbatians crossed to and fro, from the latter
as itinerant preachers, from the former as pretended
messengers from the Holy Land, and continually
incited to fresh errors. The emissary Abraham
Cuenqui, from Hebron, who in Poland and Germany
claimed charity for the poor of that city, at the
request of a mystic gave a glowing description of
the life of Sabbata√Ø, whom he had seen and admired
in his youth. This biography, a sort of Sabbatian
gospel, is an excellent example of how in the field
of religion history takes the shape of myth, and
myth again transforms itself into history. In Poland,
probably at the instigation of the crazy Mordecai of
Eisenstadt, there arose a Sabbatian sect, which
believed that it was hastening the advent of the
kingdom of heaven by penitence. At its head
stood two men, Judah Chassid (the pious) of Dubno,
a narrow-minded simpleton, and Chayim Malach, a
cunning Talmudist. Both agitated the people by
exciting sermons, and found an applauding audience,
who joined them in penances and Kabbalistic extravagances.
The association was called Chassidim.
In Poland ignorance was so great that the rabbis
themselves did not recognize the power and mischievous
tendency of these Sabbatian enthusiasts.
From 1,300 to 1,500 of this sect, under Judah
Chassid, emigrated from Poland at the beginning
of the year 1700, intending to journey to the Holy
Land, to await redemption there. Like the Christian
flagellants of old, these so-called devotees
distinguished themselves by fasting many days, and
by mortifications of every kind. The leaders wore
on the Sabbath white garments of satin or cloth,
whereby they intended to signify the time of grace.
Wherever they went in Germany, they preached,
and exhorted to strict penance. Judah Chassid by
his powerful voice, his gestures, and bitter tears,
carried away his hearers. He wrought especially
upon the weak minds of women, to whom, contrary<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_213" id="Page_213">213</a></span>
to custom, he was wont to preach, with a Torah
roll under his arm, in the women's gallery. While
the greater number of the Chassidim were assembling
in Moravia and Hungary, Judah Chassid
traveled with about 150 persons through Germany
from Altona to Frankfort-on-the-Main and Vienna,
everywhere preaching, wailing, and warning. The
sect, especially in the larger communities, was richly
supported. On account of the concourse of men
and women who flocked to these sectarians, the
rabbis did not venture to oppose their proceedings.
Samuel Oppenheim, the rich court Jew at Vienna,
supported the Chassidim richly, and procured passports
for them to the East.</p>

<p>The enthusiasm of this sect soon came to an end.
On the first day after their arrival in Jerusalem their
principal leader Judah Chassid died; his followers
were helpless, and instead of speedy redemption
found only horrible misery. Some of the Chassidim,
therefore, disappointed and in despair, went over to
Islam. The rest dispersed in all directions. Many
were baptized as Christians, amongst them Judah
Chassid's nephew, Wolf Levi of Lublin, who took
the name of Francis Lothair Philippi; another
nephew, Isaiah Chassid, afterwards caused fresh
Sabbatian disturbances. Chayim Malach, however,
who made the acquaintance of the aged Samuel
Primo, Sabbata√Ø Zevi's private secretary and counselor,
remained for several years in Jerusalem, and
presided over a small Sabbatian sect. He also
taught the doctrine of two Gods or three Gods, and
of the Divine incarnation, paid Sabbata√Ø Zevi divine
reverence, and is said to have carried about his
image, carved in wood, in the synagogue, to be
worshiped, and his followers are said to have danced
round it. Chayim Malach aimed at the destruction
of Rabbinical Judaism or Judaism in general. It is
incomprehensible how the community of Jerusalem
could have witnessed his proceedings for years<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_214" id="Page_214">214</a></span>
without opposing them. Probably the rabbis there
shared the Sabbatian idolatry, or profited by it.
However, Chayim Malach seems at length to have
been banished from Jerusalem. He then betook
himself to the Mahometan Sabbatians at Salonica,
the Donm√§h, took part in their extravagances, then
went about preaching in several Turkish communities,
and openly taught the Sabbatian imposture.
At Constantinople he was excommunicated, and on
his second residence in that community was banished
by Chacham Bashi (about 1709). He thereupon
returned through Germany to Poland, scattering the
seed of Sabbatian heresy, destined to undermine
Judaism. His death is said to have been due to
excessive drinking.</p>

<p>At the same time that Malach was sowing seed-grains
in Poland for the process of dissolution, the
torch of discord was hurled into the Jewish camp by
two disguised Sabbatians, Chayon and Ayllon.
The one through imposture, the other through stubbornness
and dogmatism, promoted a movement
which presents very unpleasant features. Solomon
Ayllon (born about 1667, died 1728), of Spanish
descent, was born at Safet, and his mind was filled
with the errors of the Kabbala. In his youth he fell
in with the Sabbatians of Salonica, and in part
shared their extravagances. Later he went to
Leghorn, and after the death of the worthy and
accomplished rabbi, Jacob Abendana, was invited to
London to fill his place (1696&ndash;1707). Ayllon had
enemies in London who, having heard of his not
wholly irreproachable youth, implored one rabbi
after another to procure his dismissal from office.
From dread of the public scandal which would arise
were it known that a former adherent of the notorious
Sabbata√Ø had officiated as rabbi, all who were
consulted advised that the ugly story be forgotten.
Ayllon was not distinguished in any branch of
learning, not even in knowledge of the Talmud, nor<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_215" id="Page_215">215</a></span>
could he have had an over-scrupulous conscience.
While treating for the post of rabbi at Amsterdam,
the London community being unwilling to lose him,
he swore a solemn oath that he would not accept
the post offered to him, although he had already
given his consent to the Amsterdam council, and
actually accepted the office. He palliated his conduct
in a sophistical and Jesuitical manner. His
youthful predilection for Sabbatian errors, which he
does not appear entirely to have abandoned even
as rabbi of Amsterdam, induced Ayllon to give his
aid to an arrant rogue, and thereby to help in
producing profound dissensions in the Jewish world.</p>

<p>This arch-impostor, who in hypocrisy, audacity,
and unscrupulousness had but few equals in the
eighteenth century, so rich in impostors, was
Nehemiah Chiya Chayon (born about 1650, died
after 1726). He took especial delight in mystification
and extravagances, and from his youth led an
adventurous, easy life of dissimulation. The career
of this Kabbalistic adventurer is characteristic of the
demoralization of the age in various ways. Chayon
received his Talmudical instruction at Hebron,
where the Sabbatian intoxication had made many
victims. He possessed considerable logical acuteness,
was ready at discovering contradictions and
incongruities; but his giddy brain and cold heart,
bent on the satisfaction of low cravings, induced him
to make corrupt use of his powers. Of the Talmud
and Rabbinical literature he understood enough to
be able to appear at home in them, but he had no
real attraction to these studies, nor any religious
feeling. He was observant from hypocrisy; when
not watched, he disregarded the demands of religion
and morality. He could assume a serious, awe-inspiring
manner, and held men enthralled by his
attractive appearance, his Kabbalistic scraps, and
his mysterious demeanor. He generally enacted
the part of a saint, at the same time singing love-<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_216" id="Page_216">216</a></span>songs
and associating with women. He was, as he
himself confessed, in close relation with the Sabbatians
at Salonica, and had taken trouble to get
possession of their writings. He frequently conversed
with their leader, Samuel Primo, about
Kabbalistic projects. It is said that in one of these
interviews he proposed a new doctrine of a Trinity.
He composed a work in which he maintained that
Judaism, to be sure Kabbalistic Judaism, inculcated
belief in a triune God. With this manuscript in his
otherwise empty coffer he went to Smyrna, in the
spring of the year 1708, intending to seek his fortune
either with the Sabbatians or with their opponents.
He did, in fact, succeed in hoodwinking some rich
men of Smyrna. His patrons pledged themselves
mutually and to Chayon to give him powerful
support. The arch-rogue was treated at Smyrna
as a holy prophet, and nearly the whole community
escorted him to the ship which was to convey him
back to Palestine. His schemes were for the
moment crowned with success. But before Chayon
could settle down, the rabbinate of Jerusalem
launched a sentence of excommunication against
him, condemned his work, which they had not even
read, to be burned (June 1708), and refused to give
a hearing to the author. This gross blunder revenged
itself afterwards. For the moment, however,
Chayon was defeated. As one formally interdicted
by the chief college in Palestine, he could not
settle anywhere. The enthusiasm of his patrons in
Smyrna was extinguished as quickly as it had blazed
up, for the favor of men is changeable.</p>

<p>Thus Chayon after a few days of good fortune
was again reduced to mendicancy. In Italy, whither
he had gone after leaving Egypt, and where he
spent some years begging (1709&ndash;1711), his schemes
met with little sympathy. At Venice only he met
with some consideration from rabbis and the
laity. Here he printed a small pamphlet, an extract<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_217" id="Page_217">217</a></span>
from his larger work, wherein he openly set forth
the Trinity as an article of the Jewish faith, not the
Christian Trinity, but three persons (Parzufim) in
the Godhead, the holy Primeval One, or Soul of all
Souls, the Holy King, or incarnation of Deity, and
a female Person (the Shechina). This nonsense, an
insult to Judaism and its conception of God, was
repeated by Chayon in doggerel, which he recommended
as edifying prayers for the especially pious.
Bold and venturesome, he interwove with the first
verses the words of a low Italian song, "Fair Margaret."
And this blasphemous pamphlet ("Secret
of the Trinity," "Raza di Yechuda") was accepted
and recommended by the rabbinate of Venice, either
because they had not seen it before it was printed,
or because by reason of Kabbalistic stupidity they
did not perceive its drift. Chayon did not stay long
at Venice. He betook himself to Prague, where he
found credulous faith, favorable to his work of deception.
The leaders of the community, old and young
rabbis and students of the Talmud, were all filled
with it.</p>

<p>David Oppenheim, chief rabbi of Prague, more
famous for his rich collection of books than on
account of his deeds and literary work, was an
inveterate Kabbalist. To be sure he had no leisure
to concern himself about the itinerant preacher
Chayon, or the affairs of the community and the
interest of Judaism. He needed his time for money
transactions with the funds which, together with a
considerable library, his rich uncle at Vienna, Samuel
Oppenheim, had left him. David Oppenheim, therefore,
seldom met Chayon; but his son Joseph, who
was enchanted with his Kabbalistic juggling, took
him into his house. He was well received also by
the Kabbalistic rabbi, Naphtali Cohen, who was
then living at Prague, and whose thaumaturgy had
cost him dear. And if the house of Oppenheim,
and Naphtali Cohen paid him homage, who would<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_218" id="Page_218">218</a></span>
fail to exert himself for the pretended preacher or
emissary from Palestine, as Chayon professed to
be? No wonder that industrious youthful students
of the Talmud, thirsting for knowledge, thronged to
Chayon! Among these was Jonathan Eibesch√ºtz,
afterwards so notorious, who was living at that time
in Prague. Chayon preached sermons at Prague, and
entranced his hearers by his sophistical and witty
manner, which made the most inconsistent things
appear reconcilable. Now and then he allowed the
erroneous doctrine of the Salonica Sabbatians to
crop out, viz., that sin can be overcome only by a
superabundance of sinfulness, by the satisfaction of
all, even the most wicked, desires, and by the transgression
of the Torah. He told his Prague adherents,
or caused it to be circulated by his Venetian companion,
that he conversed with the prophet Elijah,
that he could compel the Godhead to reveal itself to
him, and that he was able to call the dead to life and
to create new worlds&mdash;all of which found credence.
He wrote amulets, which were eagerly sought after,
and at the same time in secret led a profligate life.
The money derived from imposture he wasted in
card-playing. At last he ventured to submit his
heretical work, his Sabbatian confession of faith in
the Trinity, to Naphtali Cohen for his opinion, and
showed him forged testimonials from Italian rabbis.
From admiration for Chayon's person Naphtali
Cohen, without even having glanced at the manuscript,
expressed not simply his approval, but gave
him a glowing recommendation&mdash;a careless habit
characteristic of the rabbis of that time, which on
this occasion was destined to revenge itself bitterly.</p>

<p>Provided with forged and filched recommendations,
Chayon deceived many other communities, those of
Vienna, Nikolsburg, Prosnitz, Breslau, Glogau, and
Berlin. He succeeded in passing himself off as a
prophet before the credulous German Jews, and in
being maintained by them. Secretly he entered<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_219" id="Page_219">219</a></span>
into close relations with a Sabbatian enthusiast or
impostor, L√∂bele Prosnitz, who cut out the four Hebrew
letters of the name of God in gold tinsel, stuck
it on his breast, and made it shine before the dazzled
eyes of the credulous by means of burning alcohol
and turpentine. Like savages, the Moravian Jews
gazed at L√∂bele Prosnitz's alcohol miracle. At
Berlin, where Chayon spent several months, he enjoyed
the best opportunity to fish in troubled waters.
The community of Berlin, increased to more than a
hundred families, had fallen into disunion, apparently
through two mutually hostile families at court. The
widow of the court jeweler, Liebmann, was a favorite
of King Frederick I, and was therefore disliked by
the crown prince, afterwards Frederick William I.
The latter had his own Jew in attendance, Marcus
Magnus, the mortal enemy of the house of Liebmann,
not merely from complaisance to the successor to
the throne. The feud between the two Jewish
houses in Berlin spread to the whole community,
divided it into two parties, and affected even the
synagogue. When the fire of faction burned most
furiously, Chayon came to Berlin, and turned the
quarrel to his own advantage. He joined the Liebmann
party, which, though the weaker of the two,
was rich, and therefore more willing to make sacrifices.
The rabbi of Berlin, Aaron Benjamin Wolf,
son-in-law of the court Jewess Liebmann, a simple
fellow, treated Chayon with honorable distinction.
Naphtali Cohen, who had come to Berlin, could have
unmasked Chayon, but was afraid, as he said, to inflame
the quarrel still further. Thus Chayon without
molestation was able in Berlin to print his heretical
book, with which he had begun his mischievous proceedings
five years before at Smyrna. He gave his
work the artful title, "The Belief of the Universe"
("Mehemenuta de Cola"). The main text, the production
of a Sabbatian (some thought of Sabbata√Ø
Zevi himself), proclaims the "holy king," the Messiah,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_220" id="Page_220">220</a></span>
the incarnate Deity, as the God of Israel, and
as the exclusive object of reverence and worship.
Chayon added two sophistical commentaries, wherein
he proved in various ways that the God of Judaism
was the Trinity. In the prayer, "Hear, O Israel,
God is one," every Jew must needs think of this
Trinity, otherwise he cannot attain to salvation,
even if he fulfills all religious and moral duties. This
belief alone can make a man certain of bliss. So
low had Judaism sunk, that such blasphemy was
printed before the eyes and with the consent of a
rabbi&mdash;Aaron Benjamin Wolf, at Berlin&mdash;probably
at the expense of the Liebmann party! Chayon
had the audacity to order forged testimonials of
rabbis to be prefixed, as though they had read the
book and recommended it. With this work he
hastened by way of Hamburg to Amsterdam, to
make his fortune in that Jewish Eldorado, and thus
schism was introduced into the Jewish world.</p>

<p>The community of Amsterdam had been sufficiently
warned of the machinations of the Sabbatians.
The Jerusalem rabbi, Abraham Yizchaki, who had
been appointed an emissary to collect alms, behaved
like a papal legate, invested with supremacy over
everything religious, and like a grand inquisitor commissioned
to destroy the heresy which had been gaining
ground. At Smyrna the heretical writings of
the fanatic Abraham Michael Cardoso were in the
hands of a few secret Sabbatians. At Yizchaki's
suggestion these had to be given up by their owners
under threat of excommunication and severe temporal
punishment, and they were burned. The community
of Smyrna thereby felt itself freed from a
heavy burden, and was thankful to its liberator.
Yizchaki had also come to Amsterdam, and had
warned the rabbis and the communal council against
Sabbatian emissaries, and drew attention to the hint
of the Smyrna rabbinate, that a secret Sabbatian
was on his way to print Cardoso's writings. In fact<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_221" id="Page_221">221</a></span>
a Sabbatian emissary did come to Amsterdam for
that purpose. Chayon at first conducted himself
modestly, and affiliated with the Portuguese. He
presented the council with a copy of his work on the
Trinity printed at Berlin, in order to obtain leave to
sell it. He appears to have passed himself off as
an emissary from Palestine. Hereupon bickerings
arose, which began with personal feeling and ended
in wide-spread dissension.</p>

<p>The rabbi of the German community, Zevi Ashkenazi,
called Chacham Zevi, was much excited at the
news of Chayon's presence in Amsterdam. This
man, whose father had belonged to the most zealous
Sabbatians, while he himself and his son, Jacob Emden,
were destined to fight against them with vehement
zeal, was gifted with a clear head, and combined
thoroughness with acuteness in the study of the Talmud.
In his eighteenth year he had been consulted
as an expert in the Talmud. Pampered, sought
after, married while young to the daughter of a rich
man at Buda and thereby rendered independent, he
became proud, self-conscious, and vain of his knowledge
of the Talmud. On account of his Talmudical
learning he was invited to be chief rabbi of the German
community at Amsterdam (1710); he preferred
to be called Chacham. Here he looked down with
great contempt upon his Portuguese colleagues,
especially upon Solomon Ayllon, and would never
regard him as his equal in rank. "Chacham Zevi
wishes to rank higher even than the prophet
Moses," was the judgment passed upon him by
Ayllon.</p>

<p>As soon as the name of Chayon reached the ears
of the German Chacham, he connected it with a
former enemy of his at Bosna-Sera√Ø in Bosnia, where
Zevi had been rabbi for a short time, and he immediately
intimated to the Portuguese authorities that
it would be wise to show no sort of favor to the
stranger, as he was a man of evil notoriety. Nehemiah<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_222" id="Page_222">222</a></span>
Chayon explained that the mistake in his identity
was caused by similarity of names, and behaved
so very humbly towards Chacham Zevi, that the latter
soon informed the council that he had nothing
to urge against the stranger, whose identity he had
mistaken. Chayon appeared to have removed every
obstacle from his path at Amsterdam, when
Moses Chages, of Jerusalem, who was in Holland,
sounded the alarm against him, perhaps because he
feared him as a Palestinian rival. The heretical
work printed at Berlin was put before him for examination,
as some members of the council did not trust
their Chacham Ayllon. Scarcely had he looked into
it, when he raised the cry of heresy. In fact, it did
not need lengthy search in the book to find an explicit
enunciation of the doctrine of the Trinity.
The German Chacham, having had his attention
drawn by Moses Chages to Chayon's suspicious
doctrine, again notified, almost ordered, the Portuguese
council, to banish instead of favoring the
stranger. The council, not disposed to accept such
abrupt orders, requested Chacham Zevi either to
point out the heretical passages in Chayon's book,
or to join with some members nominated by the
council as a committee to examine it. Chacham
Zevi, at the advice of Chages, rejected both proposals
flatly, saying that as rabbi he was not obliged
to bring forward proofs, but simply to pronounce
final judgment. Still less did he choose to take
council with Ayllon, as this would have been tantamount
to recognizing him as a Talmudist of equal
rank with himself. The haughty behavior of the
Chacham, on the one hand, and Ayllon's sensitiveness,
on the other, kindled a spark into a bright
flame.</p>

<p>The Portuguese Chacham had reason to feel himself
slighted and to complain. His own congregation
had passed him over in this matter, shown distrust
towards him, and set his opponent over him<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_223" id="Page_223">223</a></span>
as a higher authority. Besides, he appears to have
feared the cunning adventurer, who if persecuted
might reveal more than was desirable of Ayllon's
past history and relations to the Salonica heretics.
He felt it his interest to remain on Chayon's side
and protect him against the threatened banishment
from Amsterdam. It was not difficult for him to
prejudice a member of the Portuguese council,
Aaron de Pinto, a resolute, unbending, hard man,
indifferent to spiritual problems, against the German
Chacham, and persuade him of his duty to guard
the independence of the old, respectable, and superior
Portuguese, against the presumptuousness of the
hitherto subordinate German, community. Ayllon
converted the important question of orthodoxy and
heresy into one of precedence between the communities.
De Pinto treated the affair in this light,
and the other members of the council conformed to
his resolute will. He straightway rejected the interference
of the German Chacham in an affair of
concern only to the Portuguese community, broke
off all negotiations with him, and commissioned
Ayllon to appoint a committee of Portuguese to examine
and report on Chayon's work. Ayllon added
to the college of rabbis four men, of whom only one
understood the question. This one hesitated to
join the committee, but was compelled to do so.
The others were totally ignorant of theology, and
accordingly dependent on Ayllon's judgment.
Ayllon and the council, that is, Pinto, made the
members of the committee swear to let no one see
the copies of Chayon's work handed to them for
examination, in fact, to keep everything secret until
the final judgment was pronounced. The petty
question of tolerating or expelling a begging adventurer
thus attained great importance.</p>

<p>Whilst the Portuguese committee was still apparently
engaged in the business of examination, Chacham
Zevi, in conjunction with Moses Chages,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_224" id="Page_224">224</a></span>
hastened to pronounce sentence of excommunication
against Chayon and his heretical book, because "he
sought to draw Israel away from his God and to introduce
strange gods (the Trinity)." No one was
to have dealings with the author until he recanted
his error. His writings in any case were to be committed
to the flames. This sentence of condemnation
was printed in Hebrew and Portuguese, and
circulated as a pamphlet. A great portion of the
objections raised by these two zealots against Chayon's
writings was equally applicable to the Zohar
and other Kabbalistic books. Short-sighted as they
were, they saw only the evil consequences of the
Kabbalistic errors, not their original cause.</p>

<p>Great was the excitement of the Jews of Amsterdam
over this step. Chacham Zevi and Moses
Chages were affronted and abused in the streets by
Portuguese Jews, and it was asserted that Ayllon
employed disreputable people for this purpose.
When Chages appeared the rabble shouted, "Stone
him, slay him." Attempts at reconciliation failed;
partly through the dogmatism of Ayllon, who refused
to admit himself wrong, partly through the
firmness of De Pinto, who simply had in view the
dignity of the Portuguese community. Pamphlets
increased the bitter feeling.</p>

<p>The quarrel of the Amsterdam Jews made a great
stir elsewhere, and was the cause of party strife.
Ayllon and De Pinto forbade the members of their
community, under threat of excommunication, to
read pamphlets, or to express themselves either
verbally or in writing upon the matter. They also
hastened the delivery of the verdict, which, however,
was drawn up by Ayllon alone. It declared, in direct
opposition to the decision of Chacham Zevi and
Chages, that Chayon's work taught nothing offensive
or dangerous to Judaism; it contained only the doctrines
found in other Kabbalistic writings. It was
officially made known in the synagogues (August<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_225" id="Page_225">225</a></span>
14, 1713) that Chayon was acquitted of the charge
of heresy brought against him, and that he had been
innocently persecuted. The day after, the original
cause of the strife was carried in triumph into the
Portuguese chief synagogue, and to the vexation
of his opponents, almost worshiped. The false
prophet, who had openly declared, "Come, let us
worship false gods," was loaded with homage by the
Portuguese who had staked life and property for the
unity of God. They cheered Chayon in the synagogue,
and cried "Down with his adversaries." In
secret Chayon probably laughed at the complications
he had caused, and at the credulity of the multitude.
De Pinto took care that Chacham Zevi should not
be supported by his own German community, but
should be left exposed, without protection, to the
rough treatment of his opponents. He found himself
entirely isolated, almost like a person under
interdict.</p>

<p>But help came to Chacham Zevi from without.
The rabbis whose pretended letters of recommendation
Chayon had prefixed to his work declared
them to be forged. The deepest impression was
made by the letters of the highly respected, aged
rabbi of Mantua, Leon Brieli, who, well acquainted
with the past history of the impostor, unmasked him,
and approved of the sentence of condemnation
against his heretical book. Brieli wrote urgently
to the Amsterdam council, and to Ayllon, in Hebrew
and Italian, imploring them not to lend their authority
to so bad a cause. But they remained stubborn,
answered him politely, yet evasively. The quarrel
rose higher every day in the Amsterdam community;
every one took one side or the other, defending
his view with bitterness, passion, and frequently with
vigorous action. Peace vanished from this pattern
community, and dissension was carried into family
life. Matters had gone so far that the leaders
could not yield. Ayllon and De Pinto went to<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_226" id="Page_226">226</a></span>
greater lengths in their obstinacy. They suggested
that the Portuguese council summon Chacham Zevi,
the rabbi of the German community (over whom it
had no authority whatever), before its tribunal, with
the intention of shaming him or of inducing him to
recant. When he paid no heed, it laid him and
Moses Chages under the ban, most strictly forbidding
the members of the community to have dealings
with them, protect them, or intercede for them with
the civic authorities.</p>

<p>As though the council and the rabbinate had been
infected by Chayon's baseness, they committed one
meanness after another. In justification of their
course of action they distorted the actual state of
the case, and made use of notorious falsehoods.
They encouraged, or at least countenanced, Chayon
in calumniating his opponents with the vilest and
most revolting aspersions, not only Chacham Zevi
and Chages, but even the wise and venerable rabbi,
Leon Brieli, and supported Chayon in all his audacities.
The Portuguese council and the rabbinate,
or rather De Pinto and Ayllon, for their colleagues
were mere puppets, persecuted Chayon's opponents
as though they were lost to all feeling of right.
With Moses Chages they had an easy game. He
lived on the Portuguese community; and when they
withdrew the means of sustenance, he was compelled
to leave Amsterdam with his helpless family
and migrate to Altona. They also pressed Chacham
Zevi hard, annoyed him, accused him before the civil
authorities, and prevented any one's assisting him.
He, too, left Amsterdam, either De Pinto procuring
his banishment at the hands of the magistrates, or
Chacham Zevi, in order to anticipate scandalous
expulsion, going into banishment of his own accord.
He repaired to London, in the first instance, then
by way of Breslau to Poland, and was everywhere
honorably received and treated.</p>

<p>His opponents, Chayon, Ayllon, and De Pinto, were<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_227" id="Page_227">227</a></span>
not able to enjoy the fruits of their victory. The
apparently trivial dispute had assumed large dimensions.
Almost all the German, Italian, Polish, and
even some African communities with their rabbis
espoused the cause of the persecuted Chacham Zevi,
and hurled sentences of excommunication upon the
unscrupulous heretic. These anathemas were published,
and unsparingly revealed Chayon's villainy,
bringing to light the sentence passed upon him
years before at Jerusalem. The exposure of his
character by witnesses who came from countries
where his past history was well known, contributed
to ruin the false prophet of the new Trinity.</p>

<p>But the Portuguese of Amsterdam, or at least
their leaders, would not drop him, either because
they believed his audacious lies or from a sense of
shame and obstinacy. They saw clearly, however,
that Chayon must take steps to calm the storm
raised against him. They therefore favored his
journey to the East, providing him with money and
recommendations to influential Jews and Christians,
who were to aid him in loosing the ban passed upon
him in the Turkish capital. But the journey proved
full of thorns for Chayon; no Jew admitted him into
his house, or gave him entertainment. Like Cain,
curse-laden, he was obliged to flee from place to
place in Europe. At last he had to take ship in
haste to Constantinople. He was followed by fresh
accusations of heresy, not only from Chages and
Naphtali Cohen, but also from the highly esteemed
Kabbalist Joseph Ergas, and the London preacher
David Nieto, who calmly exposed, in Hebrew and
Spanish, the heresy, falsehood, and villainy of this
hypocritical Sabbatian.</p>

<p>At Constantinople Chayon was avoided by the
Jews, and treated as an outcast; but his Amsterdam
letters of recommendation paved the way for him
with a vizir, who ordered his Jewish agents to accord
him support. In spite of his artifices, however, the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_228" id="Page_228">228</a></span>
rabbinate of Constantinople refused to remove the
sentence against him, but referred him to the college
of Jerusalem, the first to proscribe him. Several
years elapsed before three rabbis, probably intimidated
by the vizir, declared themselves ready to
free Chayon from the ban, but they added the condition
that he should never again teach, preach, or
publish Kabbalistic doctrines. Chayon bound himself
by a solemn oath, given to be broken at the
first opportunity. With a letter, which testified to
his re-admission into the Jewish communion, he
hastened to Europe for fresh adventures and impostures.</p>

<p>Meanwhile the Sabbatian intoxication had spread
in Poland, especially in Podolia and the district of
Lemberg. There are revolting evidences extant
of the immorality of the Podolian Sabbatians: how
they wallowed in a pool of shameless profligacy, all
the while pretending to redeem the world. Their
violation and contempt of Talmudical Judaism were
for a long time kept secret, but they strove to win
adherents, preaching, and explaining the Zohar to
support their immoral theories. As their sect grew,
they raised the mask of piety a little, came out more
boldly, and were solemnly excommunicated by the
Lemberg rabbinate with extinguished tapers in the
synagogue. But this sect could not be suppressed
by such means. Its members were inspired with a
fanatical desire to scorn the Talmud, the breath of
life of the Polish Jews, and to set up in its place the
Kabbala and its Bible, the Zohar, and this plan they
endeavored to put into execution.</p>

<p>Their leaders secretly sent (1725) an emissary in
the person of Moses Me√Ør Kamenker into Moravia,
Bohemia, and Germany, to establish a connection
with the Sabbatians of these countries, and perhaps
also to beg for money for their undertaking. Kamenker
traveled through several communities without
being found out. Who could divine the thoughts<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_229" id="Page_229">229</a></span>
of this begging Polish rabbi, who understood how
to dispute in the manner of the Talmud, and rolled
his eyes in a pious, hypocritical manner? Moses
Me√Ør entered into relations with Jonathan Eibesch√ºtz
at Prague, who though young was regarded as a
most thorough and acute Talmudist, but who was
entangled in the snares of the Sabbatian Kabbala.
Moses Me√Ør pressed on unrecognized to Mannheim,
where a secret Sabbatian of Judah Chassid's following
passed himself off among his companions as the
Messiah returned to earth. From Mannheim these
two Polish Sabbatians threw out their nets, and
deluded the simple with sounding phrases from the
Zohar. Their main doctrine was that Jews devoted
to the Talmud had not the right faith, which was
rooted only in the Kabbala. At the same time a
work, apparently Kabbalistic, was disseminated
from Prague. Its equal can scarcely be found for
absurdity, perversity, and blasphemy; the coarsest
notions being brought into connection with the
Godhead in Talmudic and Zoharistic forms of expression.
It also develops the doctrine of persons
in the Godhead&mdash;the Primeval One and the God
of Israel, and hints that from a higher standpoint
the Torah and the laws have no significance. It
was reported at the time that Jonathan Eibesch√ºtz
was the author of this production, as revolting as it
is absurd.</p>

<p>Chance brought these underhand proceedings to
light. Moses Me√Ør was enticed to Frankfort by
promises, and in the house of Rabbi Jacob Kahana
his conduct was exposed. Many heretical writings
were found upon him as well as letters by Sabbatians,
amongst them letters from and to Eibesch√ºtz.
An examination of witnesses was held by three rabbis
(July, 1725). Several witnesses denounced Moses
Me√Ør, Isaiah Chassid, and L√∂bele Prosnitz as closely
allied fanatical Sabbatians, Eibesch√ºtz also being
connected with them. These three, indeed, regarded<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_230" id="Page_230">230</a></span>
him as Sabbata√Ø's successor, as the genuine Messiah.
The witnesses averred that they had received
Kabbalistic heretical writings about the Song of
Solomon, and others, from Moses Me√Ør. They
pretended also to have heard many blasphemies
that could not be repeated. Because of the writings
found upon Moses Me√Ør Kamenker and the
testimony of witnesses, the rabbinate of Frankfort
pronounced upon him, his companions, and all
Sabbatians, the severest possible sentence, decreeing
that no one should have dealings with them in
any form whatever, and that every Jew should be
bound to inform the rabbis of the secret Sabbatians,
and reveal their misconduct without respect of
persons. The rabbis of the German communities
of Altona-Hamburg and Amsterdam joined in this
sentence; they ordered it to be read in the synagogues
for the information of all, and had it printed.
The same was done at Frankfort-on-the-Oder at
fair-time in the presence of many Jews from other
towns, and several Polish rabbis did the same.
They at last realized that only by united forces and
continuous efforts could an end be put to the follies
of the Sabbatians.</p>

<p>Just at this time Chayon returned to Europe, and
increased the confusion. To protect himself from
persecution, he secretly approached Christians,
obtained access to the imperial palace at Vienna,
partly severed his connection with the Jews, reviled
them as blind men who reject the true faith, let it be
understood that he, too, taught the doctrine of the
Trinity, and that he could bring over the Jews.
Provided with a letter of protection from the court,
he proceeded on his journey, and again played a
double game, living secretly as a Sabbatian, openly
as an orthodox Jew released from the interdict.
It is hardly credible, as contemporaries relate of
Chayon, that at the age of nearly eighty, he took
about with him as his wife a notorious prostitute,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_231" id="Page_231">231</a></span>
whom he had picked up in Hungary. He did not
meet with so good a reception this time; distrust
had been excited against secret Sabbatians, especially
against him. At Prague he was not admitted
into the city. At Berlin, Chayon wrote to a former
acquaintance that, if the money he needed were not
sent him, he was resolved to be baptized to the
disgrace of the Jews. At Hanover, his papers were
taken from him, which exposed him still more.
Thus the rogue dragged himself to Amsterdam in
the hope of again finding enthusiastic friends. But
Ayllon would have nothing more to do with him; he
is said to have repented having favored Chayon.
The latter was included in the proscription of the
Sabbatians and excommunicated (1726). Moses
Chages, formerly persecuted by him, now occupied
an honored position in Altona. He was considered
the chief of the heresy judges, so to say, and he
dealt Chayon the last blow. The latter could
not hold his own in Europe or in the East,
and therefore repaired to northern Africa, where he
died. His son was converted to Christianity, and,
whilst at Rome, through his false, or half-true accusations,
he drew the attention of the Inquisition to
ancient Jewish literature, which he declared to be
inimical to Christianity.</p>

<p>The disgrace and disappointment caused by visionaries
and impostors during almost a whole century,
the lamentable effects of the careers of Sabbata√Ø
Zevi and his band of prophets&mdash;Cardoso, Mordecai
of Eisenstadt, Querido, Judah Chassid, Chayim Malach,
Chayon, and others&mdash;failed to suppress Kabbalistic
and Messianic extravagances. As yet these
impostors only invited fresh imitators, who found
a credulous circle ready to believe in them, and thus
new disorders were begotten. The unhealthy humors
which, during the lapse of ages, had been introduced
into the organism of Judaism appeared as
hideous eruptions on the surface, but this might be
considered the sign of convalescence. Corruption
had seized even the most delicate organs. A gifted
youth, endowed with splendid talents, who in ordinary
circumstances would have become an ornament
to Judaism, was tainted by the general degradation,
and under the spell of mysticism misapplied his excellent
gifts, and contributed to error. It is impossible
to resist a feeling of sorrow at finding this
amiable man with his ideal character falling into<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_233" id="Page_233">233</a></span>
errors which bring him down to the level of such
impure spirits as Chayon and L√∂bele Prosnitz&mdash;a
many-colored sunbeam extinguished in a swamp. If
we denounce the Kabbala, which has begotten such
unspeakable misconceptions of Judaism, and are
justly wrathful against its authors and propagators,
we feel specially indignant when we find two noble
young men of high endowments and purity of life,
Solomon Molcho and Luzzatto, following its chimeras,
and thereby precipitating themselves into the
abyss. Both literally sacrificed their lives for dreams,
the confused imagery of which was suggested by the
dazing medley of the Kabbala. Although Luzzatto
did not meet with a tragic end like the Portuguese
Marrano who shared his convictions, yet he, too,
was a martyr, none the less because his wounds had
been inflicted by himself under the influence of excitement.</p>

<p>Moses Chayim Luzzatto (born 1707, died 1747)
was the son of very wealthy parents, natives of
Padua. His father, who carried on an extensive silk
business, spared no expense in educating him. The
two ancient languages, Hebrew and Latin, which in
Italy were in a measure a literary necessity, the one
among Jews, the other among Christians, Luzzatto
acquired in early youth; but they had an influence
on his mind altogether different from that which
they obtained over his contemporaries. Both enriched
his genius, and promoted its higher development.
Latin opened for him the realm of the beautiful,
Hebrew the gates of the sublime. Luzzatto had
a poet's delicately-strung soul, an √Üolian harp,
which responded to every breath with harmonious,
tuneful vibrations. His poetic gift displayed at once
power and sweetness, wealth of fancy and richness
of imagery, combined with due sense of proportion.
A believer in the transmigration of souls might have
said that the soul of the Hebrew-Castilian singer,
Jehuda Halevi, had been born again in Luzzatto, but<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_234" id="Page_234">234</a></span>
had become more perfect, more matured, more tender,
and endowed with a more delicate sense of
harmony, encompassed as he was by the musical
atmosphere of his Italian fatherland. Even in early
boyhood every event, joyful or sad, was to him a
complete picture, a little work of art, wherein color
and euphony were revealed together. A youth of
seventeen, he discerned with such remarkable clearness
the hidden charm of language, the laws of harmony,
deducible from the higher forms of eloquence
as from poetry, and the grace of rhythm and cadence,
that he composed a work on the subject, and illustrated
it by beautiful examples from sacred poetry.
He contemplated introducing a new meter into
modern Hebrew poetry, in order to obtain greater
variety in the succession of long and short syllables,
and thus produce a musical cadence. The Hebrew
language is usually classified among the dead
tongues. To Luzzatto, however, it was full of life,
vigor, youth, clearness, and euphony. He used
Hebrew as a pliant instrument, and drew from it
sweet notes and caressing melodies; he renewed
its youth, invested it with a peculiar charm, in short,
lived in it as though his ear had absorbed the rich
tones of Isaiah's eloquence. Incomparably more
gifted than Joseph Penso de la Vega, Luzzatto, likewise
in his seventeenth year, composed a drama on
the biblical theme of Samson and the Philistines.
This early work gives promise of the future master.
The versification is faultless, the thoughts original,
and the language free from bombast and redundancy.
His Hebrew prose, too, is an agreeable
contrast to the insipid, ornate, and laboriously witty
style of his Jewish contemporaries; it has much of
the simplicity, polish, and vivacity of the biblical
narrative. Before his twentieth year Luzzatto had
composed one hundred and fifty hymns, which are
only an imitation of the old psalter, but the language
of which is marked by fervor and purity. It was<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_235" id="Page_235">235</a></span>
perhaps during the same period that he composed
his second Hebrew drama, in four acts&mdash;"The High Tower,
or The Innocence of the Virtuous"&mdash;beautiful
in versification, melodious in language, but poor
in thought. The young poet had not yet seen life
in its fullness, nor keenly studied its contrasts and
struggles. He was acquainted only with idyllic
family life and academic peace. Even virtue and
vice, love and selfishness, which he desired to represent
in his drama, were known to him but by hearsay.
His muse becomes eloquent only when she
sings of God's sublimity. Isolated verses are faultless,
but the work as a whole is that of a schoolboy.
He was too dependent on Italian models&mdash;still
walked on stilts.</p>

<p>This facility and versatility in clothing both platitudes
and original thoughts in new as well as borrowed
forms, and the over-abundance of half-matured
ideas, which, if he could have perfected
them, might have proved a blessing to Judaism and
to himself, were transformed into a curse. One
day (Sivan, 1727) he was seized with the desire to
imitate the mystic language of the Zohar, and he
succeeded as well as in the case of the psalms.
His sentences and expressions were deceptively
similar to those of his model, just as high-sounding,
apparently full of meaning, in reality meaningless.
This success turned his head, and led him astray.
Instead of perceiving that if the Kabbalistic style of
the Zohar is capable of imitation, that book must be
the work of a clever human author, Luzzatto inferred
that his own creative faculty did not proceed from
natural endowments, but, as in the case of the Zohar,
was the product of a higher inspiration. In other
words, he shared the mistaken view of his age with
respect to the origin and value of the Kabbala.
Isaiah Bassan, of Padua&mdash;who instructed Luzzatto
in his early years&mdash;had infused mystical poison into
his healthy blood. However, any other teacher<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_236" id="Page_236">236</a></span>
would also have led him into the errors of the Kabbala,
from which there was no escape. The air of
the Ghettos was impregnated with Kabbala. From
his youth upwards Luzzatto heard daily that great
adepts in mysticism possessed special tutelar spirits
(Maggid), who every day gave them manifestations
from above. Why should not he, too, be vouchsafed
this divine gift of grace? Some of the mystical
writings of Lurya, at that time still a rarity, fell into
his hands. He learnt them by heart, became entirely
absorbed in them, and thus completed his derangement.
Luzzatto was possessed by a peculiar
delusion. His naturally clear and methodical intellect,
his fine sense of the simplicity and beauty of
the poetry of the Bible, and his √¶sthetic conceptions
with regard to Italian and Latin literature urged
him to seek clearness and common sense even in
the chaos of the Kabbala, the divine origin of which
was accepted by him as a fact. He in no way resembled
the wild visionaries Moses Zacut and Mordecai
of Eisenstadt; he did not content himself with
empty formulas and flourishes, but sought for sound
sense. This he found rather in his own mind than
in the Zohar or in the writings of Lurya. Nevertheless,
he lived under the delusion that a divine
spirit had vouchsafed him deep insight into the Kabbala,
solved its riddles, and disentangled its meshes.
Self-deception was the cause of his errors, and religious
fervor, instead of protecting, only plunged
him in more deeply. His errors were fostered by
the conviction that existing Judaism with its excrescences
would be unintelligible without the Kabbala,
the theories of which could alone explain the phenomena,
the strife, and the contradictions in the
world, and the tragical history of the Jewish people.
Israel&mdash;God's people&mdash;the noblest portion of creation,
stands enfeebled and abased on the lowest
rung of the ladder of nations; its religion misjudged,
its struggles fruitless. To account for this<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_237" id="Page_237">237</a></span>
bewildering fact, Luzzatto constructed a system of
cobwebs.</p>

<p>It flattered the vanity of this young man of twenty
to gain this insight into the relations of the upper
and the lower worlds, to explain them in the mystical
language of the Zohar, and thus become an important
member in the series of created beings.
Having firmly convinced himself of the truth of the
fundamental idea of the Kabbala, he accepted all its
excrescences&mdash;transmigration of souls, anagrams,
and necromancy. He wrote reams of Kabbalistic
chimeras, and composed a second Zohar (Zohar
Tinyana) with appropriate introductions (Tikkunim)
and appendices. The more facility he acquired, the
stronger became his delusion that he, too, was
inspired by a great spirit, and was a second, perhaps
more perfect Simon bar Yocha√Ø. Little by little
there crept over him in his solitude the fantastic
conviction that he was the pre-ordained Messiah,
called to redeem, by means of the second Zohar, the
souls of Israel and the whole world.</p>

<p>Luzzatto could not long bear to hide his light
under a bushel. He began operations by disclosing
to Israel Marini and Israel Treves, two young men
of the same way of thinking as himself, that his
guardian spirit had bidden him grant them knowledge
of his new Zohar. His disciples in the Kabbala
were dazzled and delighted, and could not keep
the secret. The result was that Venetian Kabbalists
sought out the young and wealthy prodigy at
his home in Padua, and thus confirmed him in his
fanaticism. A vivacious, energetic, impetuous Pole,
Yekutiel (Kussiel) of Wilna, who had come to Padua
to study medicine, joined Luzzatto's circle. To hear
of the latter, join him, abandon his former studies,
and devote himself to mysticism was for the Pole a
rapid, easy resolution. It was far harder for him to
keep the secret. No sooner had he been initiated
by Luzzatto than he blazoned forth this new miracle<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_238" id="Page_238">238</a></span>
to the world. Kussiel circulated extravagant letters
on the subject, which came into the hands of Moses
Chages in Altona. The latter, who had stoutly opposed
and effectually silenced Chayon and the other
Sabbatian visionaries, was, so to speak, the recognized
official zealot, whose utterances were decisive
on matters of faith; and the rabbi of the so-called
"three communities" of Altona, Hamburg, and
Wandsbeck, Ezekiel Katzenellenbogen, who had
excommunicated Moses Me√Ør Kamenker and his
confederates, was subservient to him. Chages
therefore requested the Venetian community to
suppress the newly-born brood of heretics before
the poison of their doctrine could spread further.</p>

<p>The Venetian community, however, was not disposed
to denounce Luzzatto as a heretic, but treated
him with great forbearance, probably out of consideration
for his youth, talents, and the wealth of his
family, and merely ordered him to justify himself.
The enthusiastic youth rebelled against this demand,
proudly gave Chages to understand that he did not
recognize his authority, repudiated the suspicion
of Sabbatian heresy, and insisted that he had been
vouchsafed revelations from Heaven. He referred
him to his instructor Bassan, who would never refuse
to testify that his orthodoxy was above suspicion.
In this Luzzatto was perfectly right. Bassan was
so infatuated with his pupil that he would have
palliated his most scandalous faults, and encouraged
rather than checked his extravagances. In vain
Chages and Katzenellenbogen threatened him and
the Paduan community with the severest form of
excommunication, if he did not abandon his pretensions
to second sight and mystical powers. Luzzatto
remained unmoved: God had chosen him, like
many before, to reveal to him His mysteries. The
other Italian rabbis showed themselves as lukewarm
in the matter as those of Padua and Venice. Moses
Chages called on three rabbis to form a tribunal,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_239" id="Page_239">239</a></span>
but all three declined to interfere. He exerted himself
so zealously, however, that he persuaded several
German rabbis (June, 1730) to excommunicate all
who should compose works in the language of the
Zohar in the name of angels or saints. This threat
proved effectual. Isaiah Bassan was obliged to
repair to Padua and obtain a promise from his favorite
disciple to discontinue his mystical writings
and his instruction of young Kabbalists, or emigrate
to the Holy Land. At last the Venetian rabbinate
was stirred up to intervene, and sent three representatives
to Padua&mdash;Jacob Belillos, Moses Menachem
Merari, and Nehemiah Vital Cohen,&mdash;in
whose presence Luzzatto was obliged to repeat his
promise under oath. He was compelled to deliver
his Kabbalistic writings to his teacher Bassan, and
they were placed under seal. Thus the storm which
had threatened him was averted.</p>

<p>Luzzatto appears to have been sobered by these
events. He occupied himself with his business,
wrote more poetry, and resolved to marry. He
was a happy father, lived in concord with his parents
and brothers and sisters, and was highly respected.
The evil spirit, however, to whom he had sold himself
would not release him, and led him back to his
youthful follies. A quarrel in the family and business
misfortunes in connection with his father's house, in
which he was a partner, appear to have been the
cause of this renewal of his former studies. Disquieted
and troubled in the present he sought to
learn the future by means of Kabbalistic arts. He
began once more to write down his mystical fancies,
and ventured to show them to Bassan, from whom
he obtained permission to publish them. It was
whispered that Luzzatto performed incantations by
means of magic, and that his teacher had handed
him for publication some of the sealed writings in
his custody. The Venetian council of rabbis, owing
to certain reports, was especially excited and prejudiced<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_240" id="Page_240">240</a></span>
against him. Luzzatto had written a sharp
reply to Leon Modena's forcible work against the
Kabbala; and as the latter was a Venetian rabbi,
though of doubtful sincerity, the members of the
Venetian council, Samuel Aboab and his five colleagues,
considered any attack upon him an insult to
their own honor. Their <i>esprit de corps</i> roused them
to greater activity than had zeal for their faith, when
seemingly in peril. True Venetians, they had in
their service a spy, Salman of Lemberg, who watched
and reported Luzzatto's movements to them. As
long as he was prosperous and surrounded by friends
the Venetian rabbis had treated him with remarkable
indulgence, and bestowed on him a title of
honor; but after his family fell into misfortune,
when he was on the verge of ruin, and deserted by
his friends and flatterers, their regard for him ceased,
and they could not find enough stones to throw at
him. They believed one of their number who
asserted that he had found implements of magic in
Luzzatto's house. Absurdly enough, too, they reproached
Luzzatto with having learnt Latin; to a
man who had studied this language of Satan no
angel, they said, could appear! The members of
the Venetian council of rabbis believed, or pretended
to believe that Luzzatto had boasted that
in the Messianic age his psalms would take the
place of David's psalter. They now showed themselves
as active as they had previously been negligent
in the persecution of the unfortunate author.
They sent three inquisitors to Padua to examine
him, search his house for writings, and make him
declare on oath that he would publish nothing without
first submitting it to the censorship of the Venetian
council of rabbis. The poet, deeply mortified,
haughtily answered that this council had no authority
whatever over him, a member of the community
of Padua. The Venetian rabbis then excommunicated
him, and condemned his writings to the flames<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_241" id="Page_241">241</a></span>
(December, 1734), taking care to give notice of their
proceedings to all the communities in Germany,
particularly to the "big drum," Chages. The
Paduan community also abandoned the unfortunate
Luzzatto. To the honor of his teacher Isaiah Bassan
be it said, that he adhered to him as staunchly in
misfortune as in prosperity. The rabbi Katzenellenbogen,
or rather his crier Chages, on this occasion
made the sensible suggestion that the study of the
Kabbala be altogether forbidden to young men, to
prevent their falling into deplorable errors, as had
hitherto been the case; but the proposition failed to
meet with the approbation of other rabbis. Twenty
years later the evils produced by the Kabbala
became so patent, that the synod of Polish Jews
enacted a decree to the above effect without encountering
opposition.</p>

<p>The unfortunate, excommunicated dreamer was
obliged to leave his parents, his wife and child, and
go forth a wanderer; but what grieved him even
more was separation from his fellow Kabbalists and
his mystic conventicle. He cherished the hope of
being able to print his Kabbalistic writings in
Amsterdam. Alas for his want of experience!
Who would help him after fortune had turned her
back! At Frankfort-on-the-Main he was rudely
awakened from his pleasant dream. As soon as
the rabbi, Jacob Kahana, heard of his arrival, he
insisted that he should promise on oath to abandon
his Kabbalistic illusions, and to refrain from writing
on or instructing any one in the doctrines of the
Zohar (January 12, 1735). One liberty, however,
Luzzatto reserved for himself: to pursue his favorite
studies at the age of forty in the Holy Land. Many
rabbis of Germany, Poland, Holland, and Denmark,
who were informed of Luzzatto's concessions, agreed
in advance to his excommunication in case he should
break his word. The name of Chages was of course
upon the list.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_242" id="Page_242">242</a></span>
Deeply humiliated and disappointed, Luzzatto
repaired to Amsterdam. Here a gleam of sunlight
smiled on him again. The Portuguese community
received him kindly, as though desirous of atoning
for the injustice he had experienced at the hands of
the Germans and Poles. They granted him a
pension; and he found a hospitable home in the
house of Moses de Chaves, a wealthy Portuguese,
and became instructor to his son. To be independent,
he applied himself, like Spinoza, to the polishing
of lenses, and this led him to study physics and
mathematics. He found himself so comfortably
settled that he induced not only his wife, but also
his parents to come to Amsterdam, and they were
well received by the Portuguese community. This
favorable turn in his fortunes encouraged him to
resume his chimerical theories. He repeatedly
exhorted his disciples in Padua to remain true to
their Kabbalistic studies; whereupon the council of
rabbis at Venice, which had received intelligence of
his proceedings, pronounced sentence of excommunication
in the synagogues and in the Ghetto against
all who possessed Kabbalistic writings or psalms
of Luzzatto, and failed to deliver them to the
council.</p>

<p>In addition to his various occupations, with the
Kabbala for his spiritual wants and the polishing
of lenses for his temporal needs, Luzzatto published
a masterpiece second to none in Hebrew
poetry; a drama, perfect in form, language, and
thought; a memorial of his gifts calculated to immortalize
him and the language in which it is composed.
Under the unpretentious form of an occasional poem
in honor of the wedding of his disciple, Jacob de
Chaves, with the high-born maiden Rachel de Vega
Enriques, he published his drama, "Glory to the
Virtuous" (La-Yesharim Tehilla). It differs materially
from his earlier works. The poet had in the
interval enjoyed various opportunities of gaining<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_243" id="Page_243">243</a></span>
pleasant and painful experiences, and of enriching
his mental powers. His muse, grown more mature,
had become acquainted with the intricacies of life.
Luzzatto had learnt to know the vulgar herd well
enough to see that it resembles a reed swaying to
and fro in the water, and is kept by the fetters of
Deceit in a state of ignorance and infirmity against
which Wisdom herself is powerless. He had been
taught by experience how Folly yoked with Ignorance
makes merry over those born of the Spirit,
and mocks at their labors, when they measure the
paths of the stars, observe the life of the vegetable
world, behold God's works, and account them of
more value than Mammon. Superficiality sees in all
the events of life and of nature, however powerfully
they may appeal to the heart, only the sport of
Chance or the inflexible laws of heartless Necessity.
Luzzatto had proved in his own case that Craft and
Pride closely united can deprive Merit of its crown,
and place it on their own heads. None the less he
cherished the conviction that Merit, though misjudged
and calumniated, at last wins the day, and
that its acknowledgment (Fame) will fall to its share
like a bride, if only it allows itself to be led by
Reason and her handmaid Patience, averting its
gaze from ignoble strife, and becoming absorbed in
the wonders of Creation. "Could we, with undimmed
eyes, for a moment see the world as it is,
divested of pretense, we should see Pride and Folly,
which speak so scornfully of Virtue and Knowledge,
deeply humbled." Through an extraordinary occurrence,
a kind of miracle, Truth is revealed, Deceit
unmasked, Pride becomes a laughing-stock, and the
fickle mob is led to recognize true Merit.</p>

<p>Luzzatto in his dramatic parable clothes and
vivifies this train of ideas, and enunciates them in
monologues and dialogues through the mouth of
acting, or, more correctly, speaking characters.
Luzzatto's masterpiece is indeed not a drama in<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_244" id="Page_244">244</a></span>
the strict sense of the word. The characters represented
are not of flesh and blood, but mere abstractions:
Reason and Folly, Merit and Deceit, are
placed on the stage. The dramatic action is slight.
It is in truth a beautiful wreath of fragrant flowers
of poesy, a series of delightful monologues and
dialogues. In it Luzzatto embodies deep thoughts,
difficult to quicken into life or to paint in poetical
colors; but he succeeded. The wonderful evolution
of the vegetable world, the extraordinary phenomena
of light, are treated in dramatic verse by Luzzatto
with the same facility as the appropriate subjects
for poetry, and this too in the Hebrew language,
not readily lending itself to new forms of thought,
and with the self-imposed fetters of a meter never
sinned against. His style is dignified, and he
employed a diction quite his own, replete with
youthful charms, beauty, and harmony. Thereby he
supplied a new impulse for the coming age. When
the mists of error passed away, the general chaos
of thought was reduced to some sort of order, and
a happier period opened, young poets derived
inspiration from the soft warm rays diffused by the
genius of Luzzatto. A modern Hebrew poet who
helped to accomplish the transition from the old to
the new period, David Franco Mendes, owes his
inspiration to Luzzatto.</p>

<p>What might not Luzzatto have accomplished if
he could have liberated his mind from the extravagant
follies of the Kabbala! But it held him captive,
and drew him not long after the completion of his
drama (about 1744) to Palestine. Here he hoped
to be able to follow unmolested the inspirations of
his excited fancy, or play the <i>r√¥le</i> of a Messiah.
From Safet, too, he continued his communications
with his band of disciples; but before he could commence
operations he fell a victim to the plague, in
the fortieth year of his age. His body was buried in
Tiberias. The two greatest modern Hebrew poets,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_245" id="Page_245">245</a></span>
Luzzatto and Jehuda Halevi, were to rest in Hebrew
soil. Even the tongues of the slanderous Jews of
Palestine, to whom Luzzatto, with his peculiarities,
must have seemed an enigma, could only speak well
of him after his death. Nevertheless he sowed bad
seed. His Italian followers reintroduced the Kabbala
into Italy. His Polish disciple, Yekutiel of
Wilna, whose buffooneries had first got him into
trouble, is said to have led an adventurer's life in
Poland and Holland, playing scandalous tricks
under the mask of mysticism. Another Pole, Elijah
Olianow, who belonged to Luzzatto's following, and
proclaimed him as Messiah and himself as his Elijah,
did not enjoy the best of reputations. This man
took part in the disgraceful disorders which broke
out in Altona after Luzzatto's death, and which,
again stirring up the Sabbatian mire, divided the
Jews of Europe into two hostile camps.</p>

<p>The foul pool which for centuries, since the prohibition
of free inquiry and the triumph of its enemy
the Kabbala, had been in process of formation in
Judaism was, with perverse stupidity, being continually
stirred up, defiling the pure and the impure.
The irrational excitement roused by the vain, false
Messiah of Smyrna was not suppressed by the proscription
of Chayon and the Polish Sabbatians, but
showed a still more ill-favored aspect, forcing its
way into circles hitherto closed against it. The
rabbis, occupied with the practical and dialectical
interpretation of the Talmud, had hitherto refused
admission to the Kabbala on equal terms, and only
here and there had surreptitiously introduced something
from it. They had opposed the Sabbatian
heresy, and pronounced an anathema against it. But
one influential rabbi espoused its cause, invested it
with importance, and so precipitated a conflict which
undermined discipline and order, and blunted still
more the sense of dignity and self-respect, of truth
and rectitude. The occasion of the conflict was the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_246" id="Page_246">246</a></span>
petty jealousy of two rabbis. Its true origin lay
deeper, in intellectual perversity and the secret dislike
on the one hand to the excess of ritualistic observances,
and on the other to the extravagances
of the Kabbala. The authors of this far-reaching
schism&mdash;two Polish rabbis of Altona&mdash;each unconsciously
had taken a step across the threshold of
orthodoxy. Diametrically opposed to each other in
faculties and temperament, they were suited by their
characters to be pitted against each other. Both
Jonathan Eibesch√ºtz and Jacob Emden had taken
part in the foregoing conflicts, and eventually gave
these quarrels a more extended influence.</p>

<p>Jonathan Eibesch√ºtz, or Eibesch√ºtzer (born at
Cracow 1690, died 1764), was descended from a
Polish family of Kabbalists. His father, Nathan
Nata, was for a short time rabbi of the small Moravian
town of Eibenschitz, from which his son derived
his surname. Endowed with a remarkably
acute intellect and a retentive memory, the youthful
Jonathan, early left an orphan, received the irregular
education, or rather bewildering instruction of the
age, which supplied him with only two subjects on
which to exercise his brains&mdash;the far-reaching sphere
of the Talmud, with its labyrinthine mazes, and the
ensnaring Kabbala, with its shallows full of hidden
rocks. The one offered abundant food for his
hungry reason, the other for his ill-regulated fancy.
With his hair-splitting ingenuity he might have made
an adroit, pettifogging attorney, qualified to make
out a brilliant and successful justification for the
worst case; or, had he had access to the higher
mathematics of Newton and Leibnitz, he might have
accomplished much in this field as a discoverer.
Eibesch√ºtz had some taste for branches of learning
beyond the sphere of the Talmud, and also a certain
vanity that made him desire to excel in them; but
this he could not satisfy. The perverted spirit of
the Polish and German Jews of the time closed to<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_247" id="Page_247">247</a></span>
every aspiring youth the gates of the sciences based
on truth and keen observation, and drove him into
the mazes of Rabbinical and Talmudic literature.
From lack of more wholesome food for his active
intellect, young Eibesch√ºtz filled his brain with pernicious
matter, and want of method forced him into
the crooked paths of sophistry. He imagined
indeed, or wished it to be supposed, that he had
acquired every variety of knowledge, but his writings
on subjects not connected with the Talmud, so far
as it is possible to judge of them, his sermons, his
Kabbalistic compositions, and a mass of occasional
papers, reveal nothing that can be described as
wisdom or solid learning. Eibesch√ºtz was not even
familiar with the Jewish philosophers who wrote in
Hebrew; he was at home only in the Talmud. This
he could manipulate like soft clay, give it any form
he desired, and he could unravel the most intricately
entangled skeins. He surpassed all his contemporaries
and predecessors not only in his knowledge
of the Talmud, but also in ready wit.</p>

<p>But Eibesch√ºtz did not derive complete satisfaction
from his scholarship; it only served to sharpen
his wits, afford him amusement, and dazzle others.
His restless nature and fiery temperament could
not content themselves with this, but aspired to a
higher goal. This goal, however, was unknown
even to himself, or was only dimly shadowed before
his mind. Hence his life and conduct appear enigmatical
and full of contradictions. Had he lived in
the age of the struggle for reform, for the loosening
of the bands of authority, he would have been among
the assailants, and would have employed his Talmudical
learning and aggressive wit as levers to
upheave the edifice of Rabbinical Judaism, and oppose
the Talmud with the weapons it had supplied.
For he was easy-going, and disliked the gloomy
piety of the German and Polish Jews; and though
impressed by it, he lacked fervor to yield to its influence.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_248" id="Page_248">248</a></span>
He therefore found mysticism as interpreted
by the followers of Sabbata√Ø very comforting:
the Law was to be abolished by the commencement
of the Messianic era, or the spirit of the Kabbala
demanded no over-scrupulousness with regard to
trifles. Nehemiah Chayon appears to have made a
great impression on young Eibesch√ºtz in Prague or
Hamburg. With the Sabbatian L√∂bele Prosnitz,
he was in constant, though secret intercourse. He
studied thoroughly the works of Abraham Michael
Cardoso, though they had been publicly condemned
and branded as heretical. Eibesch√ºtz had adopted
the blasphemous tenets of these and other Sabbatians&mdash;namely,
that there is no relation of any
kind between the Most High God, the First Cause,
and the Universe, but that a second person in the
Godhead, the God of Israel, the image and prototype
of the former, created the world, gave the Law,
chose Israel, in short governs the Finite. He appears
to have embraced also the conclusions deduced
from this heretical theory, that Sabbata√Ø Zevi was
the true Messiah, that the second person of the
Godhead was incorporated in him, and that by his
appearance the Torah had ceased to have any
importance.</p>

<p>But Eibesch√ºtz had not sufficient strength of
character or determination to act in conformity with
his convictions. It would have been contrary to his
nature to break openly with Rabbinical Judaism, and
by proclaiming himself an anti-Talmudist, as had
been done by several Sabbatians, to wage war
against the whole of Judaism. He was too practical
and loved ease too well to expose himself to
the disagreeable consequences of such a rupture.
Should he, like Chayon, wander forth a fugitive
through Asia and Europe, and back again? Besides,
he loved the Talmud and Rabbinical literature
as food for his wit, and could not do without them.
The contradictions in his career and the disorders<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_249" id="Page_249">249</a></span>
which he originated may be traced to want of harmony
between his intellect and his temperament.
Rabbinical Judaism did not altogether suit him, but
the sources from which it was derived were indispensable
to him, and had they not been in existence
he would have created them. Fettered by this contradiction
he deceived not only the world, but also
himself; he could not arrive at any clear understanding
with himself, and was a hypocrite without
intending it.</p>

<p>At one-and-twenty Eibesch√ºtz directed a school
in Prague, and a band of subtlety-loving Talmud
students gathered round him, hung on his lips, and
admired his stimulating method, and playful way of
dealing with difficulties. He captivated and inspired
his pupils by his genial, one might almost say
student-like, manners, by his sparkling wit, and
scintillating sallies, not always within the bounds of
propriety. His manner towards his pupils was
altogether different from that of rabbis of the ordinary
type. He did not slink along gloomily, like a
penitent, and with bowed head, and he imposed no
such restraints on them, but allowed them great
freedom. Social life and lively, interesting conversation
were necessities to him. For these reasons
the number of Eibesch√ºtz's disciples yearly increased,
and counted by thousands. At thirty he
was regarded not alone in Prague, but far and wide
as an authority.</p>

<p>It has been stated that the council of rabbis of
Frankfort-on-the-Main had clear proofs of Eibesch√ºtz's
connection with L√∂bele Prosnitz and the
Podolian Sabbatians. Only his extensive influence
and the great number of his disciples protected him
from being included in the sentence of excommunication
pronounced against the others. He had the
hardihood to meet the suspicions against himself
by excommunicating the Sabbatians (1725). Moses
Chages, the man without "respect of persons," the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_250" id="Page_250">250</a></span>
"watchman of Zion" of that age, predicted that forbearance
would prove hurtful. In fact, Eibesch√ºtz
was at that time deeply committed to the Sabbatian
heresies, confessed the fact to Me√Ør Eisenstadt, the
teacher of his youth, who knew his erring ways, and,
apparently ashamed and repentant, promised
amendment. Thanks to this clemency Eibesch√ºtz
maintained his reputation, increased by his erudition,
his ever-growing body of disciples, and his activity.
The suspicion of heresy was by degrees forgotten,
and the community of Prague, in recognition of his
merits, appointed him preacher (1728).</p>

<p>In another matter Eibesch√ºtz left the beaten path,
and placed himself in a somewhat ambiguous light.
Either from vanity or calculation, he entered into
intimate relations with the Jesuits in Prague. He
carried on discussions with them, displaying a certain
sort of liberality, as though he did not share the
prejudices of the Jews. He associated, for instance,
with that spiritual tyrant, Hasselbauer, the Jesuit
bishop of Prague, who frequently made domiciliary
visits among Jews, to search for and confiscate
Hebrew books that had escaped the vigilance of
the censor. Through this intimacy Eibesch√ºtz
obtained from the bishop the privilege to print the
Talmud, so often proscribed by the Church of Rome.
Did he act thus from self-interest, with the view of
compelling the Bohemian Jews to use only copies
of the Talmud printed by him, and in this way
create a remunerative business, the profits to be
shared with the Jesuits? This was most positively
asserted in many Jewish circles. Eibesch√ºtz obtained
permission to print from the episcopal board of
censors, on condition that every expression, every
word in the Talmud which, in howsoever small a
degree, appeared to be antagonistic to Christianity
be expunged. He was willing to perpetrate this process
of mutilation (1728&ndash;1739). Such obsequious pliability
to the Jesuits excited the displeasure of many<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_251" id="Page_251">251</a></span>
Jews. The community of Frankfort-on-the-Main
spent a considerable sum&mdash;Moses Chages and perhaps
David Oppenheim being at the bottom of the
movement&mdash;in their efforts to obtain from the emperor
a prohibition against the publication of the
Prague edition. Eibesch√ºtz, on the other hand,
used his connection with Christian circles to avert
perils impending over the Bohemian Jews.</p>

<p>Eibesch√ºtz's early heretical leanings were not
absolutely forgotten. When the post of rabbi at
Metz became vacant, he applied for it. When the
council were occupied with the election, the gray-haired
widow of the late rabbi appeared at the
meeting, and warned them not to insult the memory
of her dead husband and the pious rabbis who had
preceded him, by appointing a heretic, perhaps
worse (a Mumar), their successor. This solemn
admonition from the venerable matron who was related
to the wife of Eibesch√ºtz so impressed the
council that his election fell through. Jacob Joshua
Falk was appointed at Metz. He remained there
only a few years, and, on his removal to Frankfort-on-the-Main,
Eibesch√ºtz was chosen in his place.
Before he entered on his duties, the Austrian War
of Succession broke out, a struggle between youthful,
aspiring Prussia, under Frederick the Great, and
decrepit Austria, under Maria Theresa. A French
army, in conjunction with Prussia and the anti-emperor
Charles VII, occupied Prague. The systematically
brutalized population of Bohemia and
Moravia conceived the false notion that the Jews
were treacherously taking part with the enemy. It
was said that Frederick the Great, the Protestant
heretic, was an especial patron of the Jews. In
Moravia, whither the Prussians had not yet penetrated,
occurred passionate outbursts of fury against
the Jews. An Austrian field-marshal in Moravia,
under the delusion of the Jews' treachery, issued a
decree that the communities, within six days, should<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_252" id="Page_252">252</a></span>
"pay down in cash 50,000 Rhenish gulden at Br√ºnn,
failing which, they would all be delivered over to
pillage and the sword." Through the devoted exertions
of Baron de Aguilar and the wealthy rabbi,
Issachar Berush Eskeles&mdash;two members of the
Vienna community&mdash;this decree was revoked by the
empress, Maria Theresa (March 21). These men
had another opportunity to avert a crushing disaster
from their brethren.</p>

<p>Jonathan Eibesch√ºtz, having been appointed rabbi
of Metz, either from self-conceit or in order to
secure for himself the post of rabbi in French
Lorraine, imprudently fraternized with the French
soldiery who occupied the town. He obtained from
the French commandant a safe-conduct enabling
him to travel unmolested to France, and thereby
aroused in the Bohemian population the suspicion
that he had a treasonable understanding with the
enemy. After the departure of the French (end of
1742), the Austrian authorities held an inquiry into
his conduct; and all his property, which had not
been seized by the Croats, was sequestered. Eventually
all the Moravian and Bohemian Jews
were suspected of treason. The most Catholic
empress, who was at once good-natured and hard-hearted,
published a decree, December 18, 1744,
for Bohemia, January 2, 1745, for Moravia, that all
Jews in these royal provinces should, "for several
important reasons," within a brief period be banished;
and that Jews found in these crown lands
after the expiration of this period should be
"removed by force of arms." Terrible severity was
shown in enforcing this decree. The Jews of Prague,
more than 20,630 souls, were obliged in the depth
of winter hurriedly to leave the town and suffer in
the villages; and the royal cities were forbidden to
harbor them even temporarily. The position of
the Bohemian and Moravian Jews was pitiable.
Whither should they turn? In the eighteenth century<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_253" id="Page_253">253</a></span>
Jews were not in request or made welcome on
account of their wealth as they had been before.
As though Eibesch√ºtz felt himself in a measure to
blame for their misfortunes, he took trouble to obtain
relief for them. He preached on their behalf in
Metz, addressed letters to the communities in the
south of France, Bayonne and Bordeaux, asking for
aid, and wrote to the Roman community begging
them to intercede with the pope on behalf of their
unhappy brethren. It was all of but little avail.
More efficacious appears to have been the intercession
of De Aguilar, Berush Eskeles, and other Jews
connected with the court of Vienna. The clergy,
too, spoke on their behalf, and the ambassadors of
Holland and England interceded warmly and urgently
for them. The empress revoked her severe
decree, and permitted the Jews in both the royal
provinces to remain for an indefinite time (May 15,
1745). In the case of the Prague community alone,
which was chiefly under suspicion, the strictness of
the decree was not relaxed. Not till some years
later, in consequence of a declaration by the states
of the empire "that their departure would entail a
loss of many millions" was the residence of all
Jews prolonged to ten years, but under degrading
conditions. They were to be diminished rather than
be permitted to increase, their exact number being
fixed. Only the eldest son was permitted to found
a family. Some 20,000 "Familianten," as they were
called, were allowed in Bohemia and 5,100 in Moravia,
who were obliged to pay annually to the imperial
treasury a sum of about 200,000 gulden. These
restrictions were maintained almost up to the
Revolution of 1848. Jonathan Eibesch√ºtz rightly
or wrongly was declared a traitor to his country,
and forbidden ever to set foot on Austrian soil.</p>

<p>If, during the first years passed in Metz, he was
so popular that the community would not allow him
to accept the post of rabbi at F√ºrth, offered to him,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_254" id="Page_254">254</a></span>
he must have made himself disagreeable later on, as
during his difficulties, he could not find supporters
there, nor any witnesses to his innocence. If he
committed only a small portion of the mean actions
with which he was reproached, his life must have
presented a striking contrast to the sermons which
he composed. Eibesch√ºtz did not feel at home in
Metz; he missed the bustling, argumentative band
of young admirers, and the wide platform on which
to display his Talmudical erudition. In France
there were fewer students of the Talmud. It was
therefore pardonable that he strenuously exerted
himself to obtain the post of rabbi of the "three
communities" (Hamburg, Altona, and Wandsbeck).
Thanks to the efforts of his connections and
admirers, and his fame as the most distinguished
of Talmudists and miracle workers, the choice fell
on him. As the Jews of the three towns had their
own civil jurisdiction, based on Rabbinical law, they
required an acute rabbi, a lawyer, and they could
not, from this point of view, have made a better
selection.</p>

<p>But an evil spirit seems to have entered Altona
with his instalment, which threw into disorder not
only the three communities, but also the whole of
German and Polish Judaism. Eibesch√ºtz, though
not free from blame, must not alone be made
answerable. The tendency of the age was culpable,
and Jacob Emden, an unattached rabbi, was more
especially the prime mover in the strife. He desired
to unmask hypocrisy, and in doing so laid bare the
nakedness of his Jewish contemporaries.</p>

<p>Jacob Emden Ashkenazi (abbreviated to Jabez;
born 1698, died 1776) resembled his father Chacham
Zevi, as a branch its parent stem; or rather he made
the father whom he admired extravagantly his model
in everything. The perverted spirit of the age prevented
his following his natural bent and inspirations.
A true son of the Talmud, he seriously believed that<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_255" id="Page_255">255</a></span>
a Jew ought to occupy himself with other branches
of knowledge only during "the hour of twilight,"
and considered it unlawful to read newspapers on
the Sabbath. He, too, was well versed in the
Talmud, and set a high value on the Kabbala and
the Zohar, of the dangerous extravagances of which
he at first knew nothing. Philosophy, although he
possessed no knowledge of it, was an abomination
to him. In his perverseness he maintained it to be
impossible that the philosophical work, "The Guide,"
could have been composed by the orthodox rabbi,
Maimuni. In character he was just, truth-loving,
and staunch, herein forming a sharp contrast to
Jonathan Eibesch√ºtz. Whatever he considered as
truth or false, he did not hesitate forthwith to defend
or condemn with incisive acuteness; it was contrary
to his nature to conceal, dissimulate, hide his opinions,
or play the hypocrite. He differed from Eibesch√ºtz
in another respect. The latter was agreeable, pliant,
careless, cheerful, and sociable; Emden, on the
contrary, was unsociable, unbending, earnest, melancholy,
and a lover of solitude. Well-to-do, and
maintaining himself by his business, Emden was
always disinclined to undertake the office of a rabbi.
He was too well aware of his own craving for independence,
his awkwardness, and impetuosity. Only
once was he induced to accept the office of rabbi, in
Emden (from which he derived his surname); but
he relinquished it after a few years on account of
his dislike to the work and from ill-health, and
settled in Altona. He obtained from the king of
Denmark the privilege of establishing a printing-press;
built a house with a private synagogue, and,
with his family and a few friends, formed a community
within the community. He indeed visited
the exchange, but he lived enwrapped in a dreamworld
of his own.</p>

<p>Emden was on the list of candidates for the appointment
of rabbi to the "three communities."<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_256" id="Page_256">256</a></span>
His few friends worked for him, and urged him to
exert himself to try and obtain the post. He, however,
resisted all their solicitations, and declared
decidedly, that he would not accept the election
even if the choice fell on him, but he was none the
less aggrieved that he obtained only a few votes,
and entertained an unfriendly feeling towards Eibesch√ºtz,
because he was preferred. There was
another peculiarity in Emden's character: his antipathy
to heretics. His father Chacham Zevi had
undauntedly pursued Nehemiah Chayon and the
other Sabbatians, and had brought himself into
painful positions by so doing. Emden desired
nothing more ardently than to follow his father, and
would not have shunned martyrdom in the cause.
Since the return of Moses Chages to Palestine, he
considered himself the watchman on behalf of orthodoxy
among his fellow-believers. He was a Jewish
grand inquisitor, and was in readiness to hurl the
thunders of excommunication whenever heresy, particularly
the Sabbatian, should show itself. The
opportunity of exercising his unpaid office of inquisitor,
of proving his zeal for orthodoxy, and even of
suffering in its behalf, was granted him by Jonathan
Eibesch√ºtz.</p>

<p>At the time when Eibesch√ºtz entered on his
duties as rabbi a painful agitation was prevalent
among the Jews of the "three communities." Within
the year several young women had died in childbirth.
Every wife in expectation of becoming a
mother awaited the approaching hour with increasing
anxiety. The coming of the new rabbi, who
should drive away the destroying angel by whom
young women had been selected as victims, was
awaited with eager longing. At that time a rabbi
was regarded as a protector against every species
of evil (Meg√Æn), a sort of magician, and the wives of
Hamburg and Altona expected still greater things
from Jonathan Eibesch√ºtz, who had been heralded by<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_257" id="Page_257">257</a></span>
his admirers as the most gifted of rabbis and a worker
of miracles. How would he respond to these exaggerated
expectations? Even if he had been honest,
Eibesch√ºtz would have been forced to resort to
some mystification to assert his authority in his new
office. Therefore, immediately after his arrival, he
prepared talismans&mdash;writings for exorcising spirits
(Cameos, Kameoth)&mdash;for the terrified women, and
indulged in other forms of magic to impose upon
the credulous. He had distributed similar amulets
in Metz, Frankfort-on-the-Main, and other places.
From Frankfort a rumor had reached Altona that
the talismans of Eibesch√ºtz were of an altogether
different nature to what they usually were, and that
they were heretical in character. Out of curiosity
one of the amulets distributed by the chief rabbi
Jonathan Eibesch√ºtz, was opened in Altona, and
was found to contain the following invocation:</p>

<blockquote>

<p>"O God of Israel, Thou who dwellest in the adornment of Thy
might [a Kabbalistic allusion], send through the merit of Thy servant
Sabbata√Ø Zevi healing for this woman, whereby Thy name and the
name of Thy Messiah, Sabbata√Ø Zevi, may be sanctified in the
world."</p></blockquote>

<p>It is hard to tell which is more surprising&mdash;Eibesch√ºtz's
stupid belief in and attachment to the
impostor of Smyrna, who had apostatized from
Judaism, or his imprudence in thus exposing himself.
He had indeed altered the words a little, and put
certain letters to represent others; but he must have
known that the key to his riddle was easy to find.
These attempts at deception naturally did not
remain a secret. The amulets came into the hands
of Emden, who no longer entertained a doubt that
Eibesch√ºtz still adhered to the Sabbatian heresy.
Though he rejoiced greatly at having found an
opportunity to exercise his office of inquisitor, he in
a measure recoiled from the consequences of doing
so. Was it wise to begin a contest with a man who
had an extensive reputation as the most learned<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_258" id="Page_258">258</a></span>
Talmudist of his day, as an orthodox rabbi, whose
numerous disciples&mdash;over 20,000 it was said&mdash;were
rabbis, officials of communities, and holders of
influential posts, who clung to him with admiration,
and were ready to form a phalanx round him and
exert all their energies in his defense? On the
other hand, the matter could not be suppressed,
it having been discussed in the Jews' quarter and
on exchange. The elders felt obliged to interrogate
Eibesch√ºtz on the matter, and he replied by a
pitiful evasion. The council, whether believing
Eibesch√ºtz or not, was bound to lend him a helping
hand in burying the matter. What a disgrace for
the highly respected "three communities," which a
quarter of a century earlier had condemned and
branded the Sabbatians as heretics, that they themselves
should have chosen a Sabbatian as their
chief rabbi! Jacob Emden, from whose zeal the
worst was to be dreaded, was partially beguiled by
flatteries, partially intimidated by threats, to refrain
from publishing the affair. But these threats against
him necessarily led to publicity. Emden solemnly
declared in his synagogue that he held the writer of
the amulets to be a Sabbatian heretic who deserved
to be excommunicated, that he did not charge the
chief rabbi with their composition, but that the latter
was in duty bound to clear himself from suspicion.
This declaration caused a deep sensation in the
"three communities," and aroused vehement animosity.
The council, and the greater part of the
community, regarded it as a gross piece of presumption
and as an encroachment upon their jurisdiction.
The friends of Eibesch√ºtz, especially his disciples,
fanned the flame. Religious hero-worship was so
prevalent that some did not hesitate to declare that
if their rabbi believed in Sabbata√Ø Zevi, they would
share his belief. Without putting Emden on trial
the council arbitrarily decreed that no one, under
pain of excommunication, should attend his synagogue,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_259" id="Page_259">259</a></span>
which was to be closed, and that he should
not publish anything at his printing establishment.
And now began a struggle which at first produced
abundant evil, but which in the end had a purifying
effect. Jonathan Eibesch√ºtz published the affair
far and wide among his numerous friends and
disciples in Bohemia, Moravia, and Poland, and
painted himself as an innocent man unjustly accused,
and Jacob Emden as an audacious fellow who had
the presumption to brand him as a heretic. He was
hurried along from one untruth to another, from
violence to violence; but he nevertheless had many
partisans to support him. Jacob Emden on the contrary
stood well-nigh alone, for the few who adhered
to him had not the courage to come forward openly.
He however informed his friends, Eibesch√ºtz's
enemies, on the same day of what had occurred.
The foolish affair of the amulets thus acquired a
notoriety which it was impossible to check. Every
Jew capable of forming an opinion on the subject
took one side or the other; the majority adhered
to Eibesch√ºtz. Many indeed could not conceive it
possible that so distinguished a Talmudist could be
a Sabbatian, and the accusation against him was
accounted base slander on the part of the irascible
and malignant Emden. Great ignorance prevailed
with regard to the character and history of the Sabbatians
(or Sh√§bs, as they were termed), for a
quarter of a century had passed since they had
been everywhere excommunicated. Public opinion
was therefore at first in Eibesch√ºtz's favor.</p>

<p>Eibesch√ºtz thoroughly understood how to win
over opponents to his side, and to soothe them with
illusions. He convened a meeting in the synagogue,
and took a solemn oath that he did not adhere to a
single article of the Sabbatian creed; if he did,
might fire and brimstone descend on him from
heaven! He went on to anathematize this sect
with all kinds of maledictions, and excommunicated<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_260" id="Page_260">260</a></span>
his adversaries who had slandered him, and originated
these elements of strife. This solemn
declaration made a deep impression. Who could
doubt the innocence of a rabbi of such high standing
when he called God to witness respecting it? The
council of the "three communities" considered itself
fully justified in ordering Emden, as a common
slanderer, to leave Altona. As he refused, and referred
to the charter granted him by the king, he
was cut off from all intercourse with others, pursued
by intrigues, and relentlessly persecuted. This
treatment only aroused Emden to more strenuous
efforts. Letters had meantime been sent from
Metz with other amulets (1751), which Eibesch√ºtz
had distributed there, and the genuineness of which
he had himself admitted, clearly demonstrating that
he revered Sabbata√Ø Zevi as the Messiah and saviour.
The Metz amulets were in the main of the same
<span class="locked">character:&mdash;</span></p>

<blockquote>

<p>"In the name of the God of Israel ... of the God of his
anointed Sabbata√Ø Zevi, through whose wounds healing is come to us,
who with the breath of His mouth slays the Evil One, I adjure all
spirits and demons not to injure the bearer of this amulet."</p></blockquote>

<p class="in0">A judicial examination of these amulets had been
made by the council of rabbis and elders; and all
who had any in their possession were commanded
to deliver them up under pain of excommunication.
A royal procurator confirmed their authenticity;
that is to say, they were proved by the evidence of
witnesses under oath to be the work of Eibesch√ºtz;
who did not find one person of note in Metz to
maintain his honor. It was some small satisfaction
to Jacob Emden to know that he did not stand
alone in his conflict; but concurrence in his views
did not profit him much. The members of the
"three communities," with the exception of a small
minority, adhered to Eibesch√ºtz, and made his cause
their own. It was forbidden to speak a slanderous
word against the chief rabbi. Elsewhere his enemies<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_261" id="Page_261">261</a></span>
made plans&mdash;he received notice from all quarters as
to what was designed against him&mdash;but there was
no definite scheme. His disciples, on the other
hand, were extraordinarily zealous in his behalf.
One of these, Chayim of Lublin, had the courage,
in glorification of Eibesch√ºtz and in defamation of
his opponents, to excommunicate three of the latter
in his synagogue, Jacob Emden, Nehemiah Reischer,
and an elder in Metz, Moses Mayo, because they
had dared slander "that most perfect man, Jonathan,
in whom God glorified Himself." This decree of
excommunication was distributed throughout Poland
for observance and imitation. The remaining Polish
rabbis agreed with it, either being supporters of
Eibesch√ºtz, or having been bribed, or being indifferent
in the matter. By way of K√∂nigsberg and
Breslau, for example, large sums were sent to Poland
to commend the case of Eibesch√ºtz to the rabbis of
that country. Matters did not stop at excommunications
and anathemas; in Altona (Iyar 25=May)
they culminated in a riot. A hand-to-hand fight
took place, and the police had to be called in. In
consequence, Jacob Emden, believing his life to be
endangered through the fury of Eibesch√ºtz's partisans,
fled to Amsterdam on the next day, and was
kindly received there. Emden's wife was ordered
by the council not to part with any of his property,
as an action for damages would be brought against
him.</p>

<p>Eibesch√ºtz was acute enough to perceive that the
residence of Jacob Emden in Amsterdam might
prove dangerous, as he would have full scope, by
means of his trenchant pen, to expose the rabbi's
past history through the press. To counteract this,
Eibesch√ºtz issued to his followers in Germany,
Poland, and Italy, an encyclical (Letter of Zeal, Sivan
3, 1751), in which, under the guise of an exhortation
to bear testimony to his orthodoxy, he besought
them to make his cause their own. He urged them<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_262" id="Page_262">262</a></span>
to prosecute his adversary with all their energy and
by every possible means: it would be set to their
account as a special merit by the Almighty. It
greatly resembled the command of a popular general
to thousands of his soldiers to attack, and pitilessly
ill-treat defenseless men. To complete the delusion,
he induced two men, devotedly attached to mysticism,
but not to truth&mdash;Elijah Olianow and Samuel
Essingen&mdash;to declare that his amulets contained
nothing dangerous or heretical, but a great deal of
deep orthodox mysticism intelligible only to the few.</p>

<p>Eibesch√ºtz had not yet just grounds for rejoicing.
The excess of insolence of the newly-fledged rabbi
of Lublin in excommunicating gray-haired rabbis
aroused the leading men in the communities. A
cry of horror resounded from Lorraine to Podolia
at this arrogance, justly suspected to be due to the
instigation of Eibesch√ºtz. Three rabbis at length
combined, Joshua Falk, Leb Heschels, and Heilmann,
and others joined them. Eibesch√ºtz was
challenged to exculpate himself before a meeting
of rabbis regarding the amulets ascribed to him,
which undeniably were heretical. As was to be
anticipated, Eibesch√ºtz declined to justify himself in
any way, and the confederates took council as to
what further steps to take against him. The
scandal continued to increase. The newspapers
reported the quarrel amongst the Jews regarding
the rabbi of Altona. Christians naturally could not
comprehend the nature of the dispute. It was said
that a vehement controversy had arisen amongst
the Jews as to whether the Messiah had or had not
already appeared. The Jews were derided, because
they preferred to believe in the impostor Sabbata√Ø
Zevi, rather than in Jesus. This reacted on the
Jews, and the two parties imputed to each other
the offense of this scandal, this "profanation of
God's name." An energetic man, Baruch Yavan, of
Poland, transferred the schism to that country. He<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_263" id="Page_263">263</a></span>
was a disciple of Falk, agent to the notorious Saxon
minister Br√ºhl, and enjoyed considerable reputation
in Poland. Through his intrigues, a Polish magnate
deprived Chayim Lublin of his office as rabbi, and
ordered him and his father to be thrown into prison
(Elul=September, 1751). In Poland the controversy
assumed an ugly character&mdash;bribery, information
through spies, acts of violence, and treachery
being among its leading features. Seceders from
each party betrayed the secrets of one to the other.
Every fair and every synod were battlefields, where
the partisans of Eibesch√ºtz and Falk contended.
The proceedings at the synods were more disorderly
than those in the Polish Reichstag. When the defenders
of either side proved more numerous or
more energetic, the weaker party was excommunicated.
The supporters of Eibesch√ºtz were in the
main more active. Count Br√ºhl made them as many
empty promises of protection, as he bestowed on
their opponents through Baruch Yavan.</p>

<p>In Germany, naturally, matters were conducted
with more moderation. The triumvirate of rabbis
published a decision to the effect that the writer
of the Sabbatian amulets should be cut off from
communion with Israel. Every devout Jew lay
under obligation to persecute him to the utmost
of his power. No one might study the Talmud
under his guidance. All who supported his cause
were to be excommunicated. No mention was
made of Eibesch√ºtz's name. Many German rabbis
concurred in this moderate decision, as also the
Venetian rabbis who had excommunicated Luzzatto.
The resolution was delivered to Eibesch√ºtz and the
council of the "three communities" (February,
1752), and notice was given to Eibesch√ºtz that
within two months he must clear himself before a rabbinical
court of arbitration of the suspicion that he
was the author of heretical amulets, failing which his
name would be publicly stigmatized. This sentence<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_264" id="Page_264">264</a></span>
of excommunication was to be printed by the
Venetian council of rabbis, and published throughout
the East and Africa. But Eibesch√ºtz understood
how to meet this blow craftily. The Italian rabbis
were, for the most part, reluctant to burn their
fingers in this violent quarrel, and declined to participate
in any way. The council of rabbis at Leghorn,
especially Malachi Cohen, the last of the Italian
rabbinical authorities, inclined towards the side
of Eibesch√ºtz. The Portuguese in Amsterdam and
London designedly kept themselves aloof from this
domestic squabble among the Germans and Poles.
One broker of Amsterdam, David Pinto, alone
espoused Eibesch√ºtz's cause, and threatened Emden
with his anger if he continued his hostility. The
council of rabbis in Constantinople, dazzled by
Eibesch√ºtz's illustrious name, or in some way deceived,
declared decidedly for him, but would not
pronounce a direct sentence of excommunication
against his antagonists. What they neglected was
done by a so-called envoy from Jerusalem, Abraham
Israel, a presumptuous mendicant, who as a representative
of the Holy Land and the Jewish nation,
imprecated and anathematized all who should utter
a slanderous word against Eibesch√ºtz. Thus almost
the whole of Israel was excommunicated; on the
one side those who showed enmity towards the
illustrious chief rabbi of the "three communities,"
and on the other those who supported that heretic.
Thus the effects of excommunication were nullified,
or rather it became ridiculous, and with it a phase
of rabbinical Judaism disappeared.</p>

<p>A new turn was given this disagreeable controversy
when it was transferred from its home to
the law courts of the Christians. The fanaticism
of Eibesch√ºtz's followers was more to blame than
the conduct of their opponents. One of the elders
of Altona, who had so far remained true to the
cause of the persecutors, in a letter to his brother<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_265" id="Page_265">265</a></span>
showed himself somewhat doubtful of its justice.
This letter was opened by the followers of Eibesch√ºtz,
and the writer was set down as a traitor,
expelled from the council, ill-treated, and threatened
with banishment from Altona. There remained no
alternative for him but to address himself to the
government of Holstein, to the king of Denmark,
Frederick V, and unsparingly expose all the illegalities,
meannesses, and violence of which Eibesch√ºtz
and his party had been guilty. The injustice of the
council towards Jacob Emden and his wife was
discussed in connection with the affair. An authenticated
copy of the suspected amulets was translated
into German. The trial was conducted with extreme
bitterness; both parties spared no expense. The
plaintiff and his faction in their anger did not confine
themselves to necessary statements, but treacherously
stigmatized as a crime much that was of an
innocent nature. King Frederick, who loved justice,
and his minister Bernstorff, gave judgment against
the followers of Eibesch√ºtz (June 3, 1752). The
council of Altona was severely censured for its illegal
and harsh treatment of Jacob Emden, and punished
with a fine of 100 thalers. Emden was not only permitted
to return to Altona, but the use of his synagogue
and his printing establishment was restored.
Eibesch√ºtz was deprived of authority as rabbi of the
Hamburg community, and ordered to clear himself
with regard to the incriminating amulets, and to
answer fifteen questions propounded to him. Events
thus took an unfortunate turn for him. Even the
well-intentioned letter of a partisan sent from Poland
served to show how desperate his case was. Ezekiel
Landau (born 1720, died 1793) as a young man had
aroused hopes that he would become a second
Jonathan Eibesch√ºtz in rabbinical learning and
sagacity. His opinion as rabbi of Jampol (Podolia)
carried great weight. Landau wrote with youthful
simplicity and straightforwardness to Eibesch√ºtz<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_266" id="Page_266">266</a></span>
that the amulets which he had seen were without
doubt Sabbatian and heretical. He, therefore, could
not believe that the honored and devout rabbi of
Altona had written them. For that reason he was
as much in favor of condemning the amulets, as of
upholding Jonathan Eibesch√ºtz and declaring war
against his adversaries. He entreated Eibesch√ºtz
to condemn the amulets as heretical, and when
occasion offered clear himself from the accusation
that he was the author of the slanderous writings,
full of unworthy expressions about God, and to
condemn them leaf by leaf. This was a severe
blow from the hand of a friend. As Eibesch√ºtz
had acknowledged the amulets to be genuine, and
had only sophistically explained away their heresy,
he was now in evil case. A follower of Emden's
in addition published the correspondence and decisions
of Eibesch√ºtz's enemies, which stigmatized his
conduct, together with an account of the amulets
and their true interpretation ("The Language of
Truth," printed August, 1752). Emden himself
published the history of the false Messiah, Sabbata√Ø
Zevi, and the visionaries and knaves who had succeeded
him, down to Chayon and Luzzatto, vividly
describing the errors and disorderly excesses of
the Sabbatians for his own generation, which was
careless with regard to historical events, and had
but scanty, confused knowledge on the subject.
Thus it was made clear to many that the Sabbatian
heresy aimed at nothing less than the dethronement
of the God of Israel in favor of a phantom, and
the dissolution of Judaism by means of Kabbalistic
chimeras. But the worst that befell Eibesch√ºtz
was that Emden himself returned unmolested to
Altona, and had the prospect of being indemnified
for his losses.</p>

<p>The danger in which Eibesch√ºtz found himself of
being unmasked as a heretic in the courts of law,
and before the eyes of the world, determined him to<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_267" id="Page_267">267</a></span>
a step which a rabbi of the old stamp of honest
piety, even under peril of death, would not have
taken. He associated himself with an apostate
baptized Jew, formerly his pupil, in order to obtain
assistance from him in his difficulties. Moses Gerson
Cohen, of Mitau, who, on his mother's side,
was descended from Chayim Vital Calabrese, had
studied the Talmud under Eibesch√ºtz in Prague for
seven years, then traveled in the East, and, after
his return to Europe, had been baptized in Wolfenb√ºttel
under the name Charles Anton. He was appointed
by his patron, the duke of Brunswick,
Reader in Hebrew in Helmst√§dt. It was afterwards
proved that this convert had become a Christian
solely from self-interest.</p>

<p>To him the chief rabbi of the "three communities"
secretly repaired in order to induce him to
compose a vindication, or rather a panegyric, of his
conduct. It is evident on the face of it, even at the
present day, that the work was written "to order,"
and it transpired that Eibesch√ºtz had dictated it to
Charles Anton. He is extolled as the most sagacious
and upright Jew of his time, as a man versed
in philosophy, history, and mathematics, and as a
persecuted victim. Jacob Emden, on the other
hand, is represented as an incompetent, envious fellow.
Anton dedicated this work to the king of
Denmark, and commended to him the case of the
alleged innocent and persecuted man. This work,
with another cunningly chosen expedient, had favorable
results for Eibesch√ºtz. He had screened himself
not only behind a baptized Jew, but behind a
princess. King Frederick V had married, as his
second wife, a princess of Brunswick, Maria Juliana,
and a Jewish agent&mdash;a partisan of Eibesch√ºtz&mdash;did
business at the court of Brunswick. The latter
made the most of his direct and indirect influence
with the young Danish princess, and said a good
word to her on behalf of the chief rabbi under accusation<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_268" id="Page_268">268</a></span>
of heresy. With the comment that the majority
of rabbis except some litigious, malevolent individuals
sided with Eibesch√ºtz&mdash;proof of the justice
of his cause&mdash;the court suppressed the amulet case.
A royal decree, forbidding the continuation of this
controversy, was read aloud in the Altona synagogue
(February 7, 1753). At the suggestion of
the government the vote of the community with regard
to Eibesch√ºtz was again taken, and resulted in
his favor. He then took the oath of fealty to the
king, and his position was more assured than ever.
His sagacity had a second time gained the day, but
his success was only transitory. The number of his
enemies had materially increased even in Altona
through the far-reaching dissensions and the better
knowledge of his character gleaned little by little.
His adversaries did not allow themselves to be
silenced by the king's arbitrary decision without
making another effort; and the rabbinical triumvirate
urged them to petition for a revision of the
heresy proceedings against Eibesch√ºtz, and try to
convince the king that the assertion that the majority
of the rabbis were his partisans was entirely
false, that, on the contrary, he was supported only
by his relatives and disciples. The three rabbis
and the rabbi of Hanover laid before the council a
demand to consider Eibesch√ºtz as excommunicated,
and forbid him to exercise any rabbinical function
until he repented of his heresy, and promised
amendment. Hostile writings by Emden and
others fed the fire of dissension; they were written
in vehement, pitiless language and were full
of petty gossip. To calm the public wrath, the Altona
council with great difficulty induced Eibesch√ºtz
to make a binding declaration that he was prepared
of his own free-will to justify himself before an impartial
rabbinical court of arbitration, and submit to
its decision (beginning of 1753). This only inflamed
the strife. Eibesch√ºtz proposed as his judges<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_269" id="Page_269">269</a></span>
two rabbis, of Lissa and Glogau, men but little
known, who were to add a third to their number.
But the opposite party insisted that the court be
composed of Joshua Falk and his colleagues. This
angered Eibesch√ºtz, who lost the calmness of mind
he had hitherto maintained. At one time he desired
to submit his cause to the rabbis of Constantinople,
at another he proposed the Synod of the Four
Polish Countries, to meet in Jaroslav late in the
summer of 1753. He appears to have reckoned on
obtaining a favorable sentence from this assemblage
of many rabbis and influential persons. Relying on
this, he believed that he could easily free himself
from the compact forced upon him, of submitting to
arbitration. He is said to have managed this by
giving information at court that the royal prerogative
had been encroached upon by this proposed
appeal from the judgment of the sovereign to that
of the rabbis. Both parties were therefore fined by
the magistrates. This only increased his enemies,
and several of his warmest supporters, former members
of the communal council, renounced him, and
proclaimed him, not only a heretic, but an intriguer.
These opponents complained once more to the king
with regard to the prevalent dissensions in the community,
of which he was the cause. They could
not, they said, obtain impartial judgment from him
in their lawsuits, because he allowed himself to be
guided in his decisions by spite and passion. The
justice-loving king gave these complaints his attention.
He desired to arrive at a definite conclusion
with regard to the case, whether Eibesch√ºtz was an
arch-heretic, as his opponents maintained, or a persecuted
innocent, as he described himself.</p>

<p>With this in view the king ordered certain Christian
professors and theologians versed in Hebrew,
to give him their opinion with regard to the amulets.
Eibesch√ºtz felt uneasy at the turn affairs had taken;
he feared that the matter might prove disastrous to<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_270" id="Page_270">270</a></span>
him. To place himself in a favorable light he resolved
on a course which he had hitherto hesitated
to adopt&mdash;to dispose public opinion in his favor
through the press. As things then stood, there was
no other course open to him, and he therefore composed
a defense&mdash;"The Tables of Testimony," completed
Tammuz 18, end of June, 1755, the first production
of his pen. As might have been expected
from a man of his ability, it is skillfully worked out;
and he places his case in a favorable light. But
Eibesch√ºtz was unable to convince either his impartial
contemporaries or posterity of his innocence.
On the contrary, his vindication, and much of the
evidence adduced, clearly betray his guilt. Emden
and his disciple David Gans did not fail to publish
refutations, drawing attention to weak points, and
throwing doubt on the testimony in favor of
Eibesch√ºtz.</p>

<p>A publication by a professor and pastor, David
Frederick Megerlin, early in 1756, made a fresh
diversion, apparently in Eibesch√ºtz's favor, with
respect to this vexed question. This confused
babbler and proselytizer, induced by the order of
the Danish king to pronounce an opinion upon the
matter, imagined that he had discovered the key to
the enigmatical amulets of Eibesch√ºtz, the disputed
characters which his opponents explained as referring
to Sabbata√Ø Zevi being nothing less than a mystic
allusion to Jesus Christ! The chief rabbi of Altona
and Hamburg was at heart attached to the
Christian faith, Megerlin maintained, but dared not
come out openly through fear of the Jews. He
himself, it is true, and his disciple, Charles Anton,
had explained these amulets in quite another way,
not in a Christian sense; but the latter had not
comprehended the deeper meaning, and Eibesch√ºtz
had composed his vindication only for Polish Jews.
In his heart of hearts the chief rabbi was a true believer
in Christianity. Megerlin, therefore, called<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_271" id="Page_271">271</a></span>
on the king of Denmark to protect Eibesch√ºtz
against the persecutions of the Jews, especially
against the calumnies of Jacob Emden, who hated
and persecuted the Christians, as his father had
persecuted Chayon, also a secret Christian. In his
folly Megerlin exhorted Eibesch√ºtz most earnestly
to throw off his mask, resign the post of rabbi of the
"three communities," and allow himself to be baptized.
He also addressed a circular letter to the
Jews, urging them to arrange a general convention
of rabbis and openly glorify Christianity. Had
Eibesch√ºtz possessed a spark of honor he would
have repudiated, even at the risk of losing the king's
favor, his supposed adherence to Christianity. But
he did not take the smallest step to answer the
charge of hypocrisy; he was content to profit by it.
Megerlin's arguments, foolish as they were, convinced
King Frederick. He revoked the suspension
from office with which Eibesch√ºtz was threatened,
and decreed that the Jews of the Altona community
should show him obedience. The Hamburg senate,
also, again acknowledged him as rabbi of the German
community. Eibesch√ºtz exulted, and his admirers
prepared a solemn triumph for him
(Chanukkah&mdash;middle of December, 1756). His disciples,
clad as knights, marched through the streets
shouting, till they reached the rabbi's house, where
they arranged a dancing-party. The six years of
strife which had aroused every evil passion among
the Jews, from Lorraine to Podolia, and from the
Elbe to the Po, ended apparently in a dance. But
at the same time Eibesch√ºtz in another direction
suffered defeat, which branded him in the eyes of
those who had hitherto spoken favorably of him and
supported him.</p>

<p>Facts flatly contradicted his assertion, put forward
through his mouthpiece, Charles Anton, that "there
were no longer any Sabbatians." They raised their
serpent heads and shot forth their tongues full of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_272" id="Page_272">272</a></span>
poisonous rage at this very moment. The seed
which Chayim Malach had scattered in Poland was
by no means checked in growth by the anathemas
of the rabbis. They had only forced the Sabbatians
to disguise themselves better, and to counterfeit
death; but they flourished secretly, and their following
increased. Some towns in Podolia and Pakotia
were full of Talmudists who, in Sabbatian fashion,
scoffed at the Talmud, rejected the law of Judaism,
and, under the mask of ascetic discipline, lived impure
lives. The disorders to which the dispute
regarding Eibesch√ºtz had given rise in Poland encouraged
the Polish Sabbatians to venture from
their hiding-places and raise their masks a little.
The time seemed favorable for an attempt to cast
aside odious religious rites, and openly to come forward
as anti-Talmudists. They needed a spirited
leader to gather the scattered band, give it cohesion,
and mark out a line of action. This leader now
presented himself, and with his appearance began a
new movement which threw the whole Jewish world
of Poland into intense agitation and despair. This
leader was the notorious Jacob Frank.</p>

<p>Jankiev Lejbovicz (that is, Jacob son of Leb) of
Galicia, was one of the worst, most subtle, and most
deceitful rascals of the eighteenth century. He
could cheat the most sagacious, and veil his frauds
so cleverly that after his death many still believed
him an admirable man, who bore through life, and
carried to the grave, most weighty secrets. He
understood the art of deception even in his youth,
and boasted how he had duped his own father.
As a young man he traveled in Turkey in the service
of a Jewish gentleman, and in Salonica entered into
relations with the Sabbatians or Jewish Moslems
there. If he did not learn from them how to work
deceptive and mystifying miracles, he at all events
learnt indifference towards all forms of religion.
He became a Mahometan, as afterwards a Catholic,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_273" id="Page_273">273</a></span>
for so long as it served his purpose, and
changed his religion as one changes one's clothes.
From his long sojourn in Turkey he acquired the
name of Frank, or Frenk. Ignorant of Talmudical
literature, as he himself confessed, he was acquainted
with the Zoharist Kabbala, explained it to suit his
purpose, and took peculiar pleasure in the doctrine
of metempsychosis, by virtue of which the successive
Messiahs were not visionaries or impostors, but the
embodiment of one and the same Messianic soul.
King David, Elijah, Jesus, Mahomet, Sabbata√Ø Zevi,
and his imitators, down to Berachya, were one and
the same personality, which had assumed different
bodily forms. Why should not he himself be another
incarnation of the Messiah? Although Jacob Frank,
or Lejbovicz, loved money dearly, he accounted it
only a lever by which to raise himself; he wished to
play a brilliant part and surround himself with a
mysterious halo. Circumstances were exceptionally
favorable to him. He married in Nicopolis
(Turkey) a very beautiful wife, through whom he
attracted followers. He collected by degrees a
small number of Turkish and Wallachian Jews, who
shared his loose principles, and held him to be a
superior being&mdash;the latest embodiment of the Messiah.
He could not, however, carry on his mischievous
schemes in Turkey, where he was persecuted.</p>

<p>Frank appears to have obtained intelligence of
the schism in Poland caused by the Eibesch√ºtz controversy,
and thought that he might utilize the
propitious moment to gather round him the Sabbatians
of Podolia, and play a part among them, and
by means of them. He came suddenly amongst them,
visiting many towns of Podolia and the Lemberg district,
where secret Sabbatians resided, with whom he
may have been in communication previously. They
fell, so to speak, into his arms. Frank needed followers,
and they were seeking a leader. Now they found
one who had come to them with a full purse, of the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_274" id="Page_274">274</a></span>
contents of which he was not sparing. In a trice
he won the Sabbatians of Podolia. Frank disclosed
himself to them as the successor of Sabbata√Ø, or,
what was the same thing, as the new-born soul of
the Sabbatian chief Berachya. What this manifestation
signified was known to the initiated. They
understood by it the blasphemous and at the same
time absurd theory of a kind of Trinity, consisting of
the Holy and Most Ancient One, the Holy King,
and a female person in the Godhead. Frank, like
his predecessors, attributed the chief importance to
the Holy King, at once the Messiah and God incarnate,
and possessed of all power on earth and in
heaven. Frank ordered his followers to address
him as the Holy Lord. In virtue of his participation
in the Godhead, the Messiah was able to do
all things, even miracles, and Frank did perform miracles,
as his followers maintained. The adherents
whom he brought in his train, and whom he gathered
round him in Poland, believed so strongly in his
divine nature that they addressed to him mystic
prayers in the language of the Zohar, with the same
formulas that the Donm√§h of Salonica were wont to
address to Jacob Querido and Berachya. In short,
Frank formed a sect from the Sabbatians of Podolia,
called by his name, "Frankists." Their founder
taught his disciples to acquire riches for themselves,
even by fraudulent and dishonest means. Deceit
was nothing more than skillful artifice. Their chief
task was to undermine rabbinical Judaism, and to
oppose and annihilate the Talmud. This task they
undertook with a passion which perhaps owed its
origin to the constraints imposed upon them through
fear of persecution. The Frankists opposed the
Zohar to the Talmud, and Simon bar Yocha√Ø, its
alleged author, to the other authorities of the
Talmud, as though in earlier times the former had
combated the latter and accused them of being the
falsifiers of Judaism. The true teaching of Moses<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_275" id="Page_275">275</a></span>
was said to be contained only in the Zohar, which
had declared the whole of rabbinical Judaism to be
on a lower level&mdash;a fact which blundering Kabbalists
had so long overlooked. The Frankists, more clear-sighted,
had discovered the half-concealed secret of
the Zohar. They rightly called themselves anti-Talmudists
as well as Zoharites. With a certain
childish frowardness they did exactly those things
which rabbinical Judaism strongly prohibited, and
neglected those which the latter prescribed, not
only in points of ritual, but also with regard to
marriage and the laws of chastity. Among these
anti-Talmudic Frankists were found rabbis and so-called
preachers (Darshanim, Maggidim), Jehuda
Leb Krysa, rabbi of Nadvorna, and Rabbi Nachman
ben Samuel Levi of Busk. Of especial reputation
among Polish Sabbatians was Elisha Schor of
Rohatyn, an aged man, descended from distinguished
Polish rabbis. He, his sons, his daughter
Chaya (who knew the Zohar by heart, and was considered
a prophetess), his grandson, and sons-in-law
were from an early period thoroughgoing Sabbatians,
to whom it was a positive pleasure to deride
rabbinical precepts.</p>

<p>During the first months after his return to
Poland, Frank held secret conferences with the
anti-Talmudists of Podolia, as a public demonstration
was attended with danger. One day,
he with about twenty of his followers was surprised
in Laskorun in a conventicle. The Frankists
declared that they had been singing psalms
in the Zohar language, while their adversaries
asserted that they had been performing an indecent
dance around a half-naked woman, and kissing her.
Many gathered about the inn to force their way in;
others ran to the police to give information that a
Turk had stolen into Podolia to pervert the Jews
to the Mahometan religion and make them emigrate
to Turkey, and that those who had joined him were<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_276" id="Page_276">276</a></span>
leading an Adamite, that is to say dissolute, life. The
police immediately interposed, broke open the
barricaded doors, and expelled the Frankists.
Frank was dismissed next day as a foreigner, and
repaired to the neighboring Turkish territory; and
the Podolian Frankists were kept in custody. The
incident made a sensation, and was perhaps intentionally
exaggerated. Like wild-fire the news concerning
the Sabbatians spread. It can be imagined
what this defiance of Rabbinical Judaism meant in
those days, especially in Poland, where the most
insignificant religious rites were sedulously observed.
It was now discovered that, in the midst of the
excessive piety which characterized the Poles, a
number of persons, brought up in the knowledge of
the Talmud, scoffed at the whole system of Rabbinical
Judaism. The rabbis and elders forthwith
began to employ the usual weapons of excommunication
and persecution against the offenders, and
the secret heretics were hunted out. Won over
by large sums, the Polish authorities energetically
supported the persecutors. Those in distress showed
signs of repentance, and made public confession of
their misdeeds, which, be they accurate or exaggerated,
present a sad picture of the deterioration of
the Polish Jews. Before the council of rabbis in
Satanov, in open court, several men and women
stated that they and their friends had not only treated
the rites of Judaism with contempt, but had abandoned
themselves to fornication, adultery, incest,
and other iniquities, and had done so in accordance
with Kabbalistic-mystic teachings. The penitents
declared that Frank had taught his followers to
scoff at chastity.</p>

<p>In consequence of this evidence a solemn sentence
of excommunication, during the reading of which
tapers were extinguished, was pronounced in Brody
against the Frankists: no one might intermarry
with them, their sons and daughters were to be<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_277" id="Page_277">277</a></span>
treated as bastards, and none who were even
suspected could be admitted to the post of rabbi, to
any religious office, or to the profession of teacher.
Every one was in duty bound to denounce and
unmask the secret Sabbatians. This excommunication
was repeated in several communities,
and finally ratified by a great synod in Konstantinov
on the Jewish New Year (September, 1756).
The document was printed, distributed, and
ordered to be read aloud every month in the synagogues
for observance. This sentence of excommunication
contained one point of great importance.
No one under thirty years of age was to be permitted
to study the Kabbala. Necessity at length opened
the eyes of the rabbis to the recognition of the
impure spring, which since the time of Lurya had
poisoned the sap of the tree of Judaism. More
than four centuries had passed since philosophical
inquiry had been forbidden, and the young Kabbala
encouraged. In their blindness, the rabbis had
imagined that they were strengthening Judaism in
placing folly on the throne of wisdom. This course
produced that book of lies, the Zohar, which impudently
set itself above the Holy Writings and the
Talmud. Finally, the delusions of the Kabbala
declared a life and death war against rabbinical
Judaism. Such were the fruits of blindness. The
members of the synod of Konstantinov turned in
their perplexity to Jacob Emden, who, since his
controversy with Eibesch√ºtz, was accounted the
representative of sound orthodoxy. He, too, enjoyed
a triumph, though of an altogether different kind
from the one his antagonist was at the same time celebrating
in the midst of his noisy admirers. The Polish
Jews at last began to be aware that secular knowledge
and cultivated eloquence are after all not altogether
objectionable, since they can render assistance to
Judaism. They were desirous that a cultured Portuguese
should come to Poland, endowed with<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_278" id="Page_278">278</a></span>
knowledge and readiness of speech, who would
represent them before the Polish magistracy and
clergy, in order to suppress the dangerous Frankist
sect.</p>

<p>Jacob Emden, deeply affected by the despairing
appeal of his Polish brethren, came to a conclusion
of great importance for succeeding ages. Sabbatians
of all shades appealed to the Zohar as a sacred
authority, as the Bible of a new revelation, excusing
all their blasphemies and indecencies by quotations
from it. What if the Zohar should prove not to be
genuine, but only a supposititious work? And
this was the conclusion to which Emden came.
The repulsive incidents in Poland first suggested
the inquiry to him, and it became clear to him that
at least a portion of the Zohar was the production
of an impostor.</p>

<p>To the question whether it would be lawful to
persecute the Frankists, Jacob Emden answered
emphatically in the affirmative. He held them,
according to the accounts received from Poland,
to be shameless transgressors of the most sacred
laws of decency and chastity, turning vice into
virtue by means of mystical jugglery. No persuasion,
however, was required from him; when
persecution became necessary in Poland the will to
inflict it was never wanting. The Frankists were
denounced to the magistracy and clergy as a new
sect, and handed over to the Catholic Inquisition,
and the bishop of Kamieniec, Nicolas Dembowski,
in whose diocese they were apprehended, had no
objection to erect a stake. Frank was cunning
enough to avert from his followers the blow aimed
at them and to direct it against their enemies.
From Chocim, where after a brief imprisonment he
had settled in safety, he counseled them to emphasize
two points in their defense: that they believed in a
Trinity, and that they rejected the Talmud as a
compilation full of error and blasphemy. His counsel<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_279" id="Page_279">279</a></span>
meeting with opposition, he secretly assembled
some of his followers in a small town in Poland, and
reiterated his advice, with the addition that twenty
or thirty of them must quickly be baptized to give
more emphasis to their assertions that they acknowledged
the Trinity and rejected the Talmud. To
Frank change of religion was a small matter. The
Talmud Jews of the district heard of Frank's secret
conference with his confederates, collected a band,
attacked them, and after using them roughly placed
them in confinement. This proceeding provoked
the anti-Talmudists to revenge. They would not,
indeed, be baptized, but they declared before the
tribunal of Bishop Dembowski that they were
<i>almost</i> Christians, that they believed in a Divine
Trinity, that the rest of the Jews, who repudiated
this doctrine, did not hold the true faith, and persecuted
them on account of their superiority. To
make their breach with Judaism unmistakable, or to
revenge themselves in a very sanguinary way, they
made false accusations, namely, that believers in the
Talmud make use of the blood of Christians, and
that the Talmud inculcates the murder of Christians
as a sacred duty. There was no difficulty in trumping
up evidence in favor of the accusation. It was
only necessary that some Christian child should be
missing. Something of the kind must have occurred
in Jampol in Podolia (April, 1756), and immediately
the most respected Jews of the town were placed
in chains, and the other communities menaced.
Bishop Dembowski and his chapter, rejoiced at
their good luck, favored the Frankists in every way
in return for their false evidence, freed them from
prison, protected them from persecution, allowed
them to settle in the diocese of Kamieniec, permitted
them to live as they pleased, and were delighted to
foster their hatred of the Talmud Jews. The bishop
flattered himself that, through the Frankists, among
whom were several rabbis, he would be able to convert<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_280" id="Page_280">280</a></span>
many Polish Jews to Catholicism. The new
sect passed into the state in which the persecuted
becomes the persecutor.</p>

<p>In order to drive their adversaries to desperation,
the Frankists (1757) petitioned Bishop Dembowski
to arrange a disputation between themselves and
the Talmudists, and bound themselves to prove both
the doctrine of the Trinity and the harmful nature
of the Talmud, from the Scriptures and the Zohar.
To this the bishop willingly consented. One of the
Frankist rabbis&mdash;perhaps old Elisha Schor, of
Rohatyn&mdash;composed a confession of faith, which,
almost unequaled for audacity and untruthfulness,
is so artful in its explanation of Sabbatian-Kabbalistic
doctrines as to have led the bishop to suppose
that they were in consonance with the Catholic faith,
and to drive their adversaries into a corner. The
Frankist confession of faith contains nine articles.
The religion revealed by God to man contains so
many deep mysteries, that it must be thoroughly
searched out and examined; without higher inspiration,
however, it cannot be understood. One of
these mysteries is that the Godhead consists of
three Persons, equal to one another, at once a
Trinity and a Unity. Another mystery is that the
Godhead assumes human form to manifest itself
visibly to all men. Through the mediation of these
deities incarnate, mankind is redeemed and saved&mdash;not
through the Messiah expected to assemble the
Jews and lead them back to Jerusalem. The latter
is a false belief: Jerusalem and the Temple will
never be rebuilt. The Talmud, indeed, interprets
revealed faith otherwise; but its interpretation is
baneful, and has led its adherents into error and
unbelief. The Talmud contains most revolting
statements; such as that Jews are permitted, indeed,
obliged, to deceive and slay Christians. The Zohar,
which is diametrically opposed to the Talmud, offers
the only true and correct interpretation of the Holy<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_281" id="Page_281">281</a></span>
Writings. All these absurd statements, the Frankist
confession of faith supported by passages from
the Bible and the Zohar; and to vilify the Talmud,
passages in it were intentionally misrepresented.
The creed was printed and published in the Hebrew
and the Polish language. The representatives of
the Polish community&mdash;the Synod of the Four
Countries&mdash;were painfully sensible, in their desperate
situation, of the want of education prevalent among
them. They could not produce a single man who
could expose the imposture of the Frankists and
the hollowness of their creed in well-turned or even
tolerable language. The proud leaders of the
Synod behaved like children in their anxiety. They
helplessly devised extravagant schemes, wished to
appeal to the pope, and to incite the Portuguese in
Amsterdam and Rome to protect them from the
machinations of their vindictive enemies.</p>

<p>Bishop Dembowski consented to the proposition
of the Frankists, and issued a command that the
Talmudists send deputies to a disputation at
Kamieniec, failing which he would punish them and
burn the Talmud as a book hostile to Christianity.
In vain the Polish Jews referred to their ancient
privileges, screened themselves behind great nobles,
and spent large sums of money. They were obliged
to prepare for the disputation and render account
to the enemies they had so greatly despised. Only
a few rabbis appeared. What could the representatives
of the Talmud, with their profound ignorance
and halting speech, effect against the audacious denunciations
of the Frankists, particularly as they also
acknowledged the Zohar as a sacred book, and this,
as a matter of fact, formulates the doctrine of a kind
of Trinity! What happened at the disputation of
Kamieniec has never transpired. The Talmudists
were accounted as vanquished and refuted. Bishop
Dembowski publicly declared (October 14, 1757),
that, as the anti-Talmudists had set down in writing<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_282" id="Page_282">282</a></span>
and proved the chief points of their confession of
faith, they were permitted everywhere to hold disputations
with the Talmudists. Copies of the Talmud
were ordered to be confiscated, brought to
Kamieniec, and there publicly burned by the hangman.
Dembowski was permitted arbitrarily to favor
the one party and condemn the other. The king
of Poland and his minister, Count Br√ºhl, troubled
themselves but little about internal affairs, still less
about the Jews. Hence Dembowski, who at about
that time was made archbishop of Lemberg, was
allowed with the aid of the clergy, the police, and
the Frankists, to search for copies of the Talmud
and other rabbinical writings in the towns of his
bishopric, collect them at Kamieniec, and drag them
through the streets in mockery. Only the Bible
and the Zohar were to be spared, as in the time of
the Talmud persecution under Popes Julius IV and
Pius V. Nearly a thousand copies of the Talmud
were thrown into a great pit at Kamieniec and burnt
by the hangman. The Talmudists could do nothing,
but groan, weep, and proclaim a rigorous fast-day
on account of "the burning of the Torah." It was
the Kabbala that had kindled the torches for the
funeral pile of the Talmud. The clergy, in conjunction
with the anti-Talmudists, daily made domiciliary
visits into Jewish houses to confiscate copies
of the Talmud.</p>

<p>To free themselves and all other Jews from the
oft repeated, and as often refuted, accusation of
child-murder, which the abject Frankists had confirmed,
the Jewish Talmudists sent Eliakim Selig
(Selek) to Benedictus XIV, to procure an official
exposure of the falsehood of the charge brought
against Jews. Eliakim's determination and persistence
succeeded in obtaining this authoritative acquittal
in Rome at the end of 1757.</p>

<p>Suddenly Bishop Dembowski died (November 17,
1757) a violent death, and this led to a new development<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_283" id="Page_283">283</a></span>
in the controversy. Persecution of the
Talmudists immediately ceased, and from that time
the Frankists were persecuted, imprisoned, and declared
outlaws. Their beards were shaved off as a
mark of disgrace and to make them easily recognizable.
The majority, no longer able to maintain
themselves in Kamieniec, fled to the neighboring
province of Bessarabia. But they were even more
disturbed under Turkish jurisdiction. Their persecutors
informed the Jewish community of the arrival
of the anti-Talmudists in their district and of their
injuriousness to Judaism, and the former had only
to notify the Pasha and the Cadi that these supposed
Polish Jews were not under the protection of
the Chacham Bashi (chief rabbi) of Constantinople
in order to invite the Turks to fall upon the newcomers
and mercilessly rob and ill-treat them.
In despair the Frankists wandered restlessly about
the borderlands of Podolia and Bessarabia. At
length they addressed the king of Poland, and implored
him to confirm the privilege tolerating their
worship granted them by Bishop Dembowski. Augustus
III, the weakling and martyr of the seven
years' war, thereupon issued a decree (June 11,
1758) permitting the Frankists to return unmolested
to their homes, and reside in Poland wherever they
pleased. The decree was not enforced with sufficient
energy, and the Frankists continued to be
persecuted by their opponents aided by the nobles.
In their trouble some of their body were sent to beg
Frank, who had so long forsaken them, to assist
them with his advice. While affecting to demur, he
willingly obeyed their call and repaired again to
Podolia (January, 1759).</p>

<p>With his appearance the old game of intrigue
began once more. Frank was from that time the
life and soul of his followers, and without his commands
they undertook nothing. He saw clearly
that the hypocrisy of simply declaring that the anti-<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_284" id="Page_284">284</a></span>Talmudists
believed in the Trinity must not be repeated,
but that they must make more of a concession
to Christianity. By his advice six Frankists,
the majority foreigners, repaired to Wratislav Lubienski,
Archbishop of Lemberg, with the declaration
(February 20, 1759), "in the name of their whole
body," that they were all willing, under certain conditions,
to be baptized. In their petition they used
phrases savoring of Catholicism, and breathed vengeance
against their former co-religionists. Lubienski
had this petition of the Zoharites printed, in
order, on the one hand, to proclaim the victory of
the Church, on the other, to keep the members of
this sect to their word; but he did nothing for them.
Although in their Catholic and Kabbalistic language
they declared that they were languishing for baptism
"like the hart for the water-brooks," they did
not in the least contemplate an immediate formal
secession to Christianity. Frank, their leader, whom
they blindly followed, did not consider the time ripe
for this extreme measure. He reserved it to extort
favorable terms, which were embodied in an
address presented to the king and Archbishop
Lubienski (May 16, 1759) by two deputies. They
insisted especially on a disputation with their opponents,
adducing as a reason, that they wished to
show the world that they were led to embrace
Christianity, not from necessity and poverty, but
through conviction. They wished, moreover, to
give an opportunity to their secret confederates to
publicly avow themselves believers in Christianity,
which they would infallibly do if their righteous
cause should triumph in public argument. Finally
they hoped in this way to open the blinded eyes of
their antagonists. To this cunningly devised petition
breathing malice against their enemies, the
king made no reply, while Lubienski answered
evasively that he could only promise them eternal
salvation if they allowed themselves to be baptized;<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_285" id="Page_285">285</a></span>
the rest would follow as a matter of course. He
displayed no zeal whatever for the conversion of
these ragged fellows whom he believed to be dissemblers.
The papal nuncio in Warsaw, Nicholas
Serra, did not regard with favor the idea of the conversion
of the anti-Talmudists.</p>

<p>The position of affairs changed, however, when
Lubienski withdrew to Gnesen, his arch-episcopal
seat, and the administrator of the archbishopric of
Lemberg, the canon De Mikulski, showed more zeal
for conversion. He immediately promised the
Frankists to arrange a religious conference between
them and the Talmudists, if they would exhibit a
sincere desire for baptism. On this the deputies,
Leb Krysa and Solomon of Rohatyn, in the name
of the whole body, made a Catholic confession of
faith (May 25), which savored of Kabbalism: "the
cross is the symbol of the Holy Trinity and the seal
of the Messiah." It closed with these words: "The
Talmud teaches the use of the blood of Christians,
and whosoever believes in it is bound to use this
blood." Thereupon Mikulski, without consulting
the papal nuncio Serra, made arrangements for a
second disputation in Lemberg (June, 1759). The
rabbis of this diocese were summoned to appear,
under pain of a heavy fine, and the nobility and
clergy were requested in case of necessity to compel
them. The nuncio Serra, to whom the Talmudists
complained, was in the highest degree dissatisfied
with the idea of the disputation, but did
not care to prevent it because he wished to learn
with certainty whether the Jews used the blood of
Christians. This appeared to him the most important
point of all. Just at this time Pope Clement
XIII had given a favorable answer on this question
to the Jewish deputy Selek. Clement XIII proclaimed
that the Holy See had examined the
grounds on which rested the belief in the use of
human blood for the feast of the Passover and the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_286" id="Page_286">286</a></span>
murder of Christians by Jews, and that the Jews
must not be condemned as criminals in respect of
this charge, but that in the case of such occurrences
legal forms of proof must be used. Notwithstanding
this, the papal envoy at this very time, deceived
by the meanness of the Frankists, partially credited
the false accusation, and notified the Curia of it.</p>

<p>The religious conference which was to lead to the
conversion of so many Jews, at first regarded with
indifference, began to awaken interest. The Polish
nobility of both sexes purchased admission cards at
a high price, the proceeds to go to the poor people
who were to be baptized. On the appointed day
the Talmudists and Zoharites were brought into the
cathedral of Lemberg; all the clergy, nobility, and
burghers crowded thither to witness the spectacle
of Jews, apparently belonging to the same religion,
hurling at each other accusations of the most abominable
crimes. In reality it was the Talmud and the
Kabbala, formerly a closely united pair of sisters,
who had fallen out with each other. The disputation
failed miserably. Of the Frankists, who had boastfully
given out that several hundreds of their party
would attend, only about ten appeared, the rest
being too poor to undertake the long journey and
attire themselves decently. Of the Talmudists
forty were present owing to their dread of the
threatened fine. How Judaism had retrograded in
the century of "enlightenment" when compared
with the thirteenth century! At that time, on a
similar occasion, the spokesman of the Jews, Moses
Nachmani, proudly confronted his opponents at the
court of Barcelona, and almost made them quake
by his knowledge and firmness. In Lemberg the
representatives of Talmudic Judaism stood awkward
and disconcerted, unable to utter a word. They
did not even understand the language of the country&mdash;their
opponents, to be sure, were in like case&mdash;and
interpreters had to be employed. But the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_287" id="Page_287">287</a></span>
Catholic clergy in Poland and the learned classes
also betrayed their astounding ignorance. Not a
single Pole understood Hebrew or the language
of the rabbis sufficiently to be an impartial witness
of the dispute, whilst in Germany and Holland
Christians acquainted with Hebrew could be counted
by hundreds. The Talmudists had a difficult part
to play in this religious conference. The chief thesis
of the Frankists was that the Zohar teaches the
doctrine of the Trinity, and that one Person of the
Godhead became incarnate. Could they dare to
deny this dogma absolutely without wounding the
feelings of the Christians, their masters? And
that leanings toward this doctrine were to be found
in the Zohar they could not deny. Of course, they
might have refuted completely the false charge of
using the blood of Christian children and of the
bloodthirsty nature of the Talmud, or might have
cited the testimony of Christians and even the
decisions of popes. They were, however, ignorant
of the history of their own suffering, and their
ignorance avenged itself on them. It is easy to
believe that the Talmudic spokesmen, after the
three days' conference, returned home ashamed and
confused. Even the imputation of shedding Christian
blood continued to cling to their religion.</p>

<p>The Zoharites who had obtained their desire were
now strongly urged by the clergy to perform their
promise, and allow themselves to be baptized.
But they continued to resist as if it cost them a
great struggle, and only yielded at the express
command of their chief, Frank, and in his presence.
The latter appeared with great pomp, in magnificent
Turkish robes, with a team of six horses, and
surrounded by guards in Turkish dress. He wished
to impress the Poles. His was the strong will which
led the Frankists, and which they implicitly obeyed.
Some thousand Zoharites were baptized on this
occasion. Frank would not be baptized in Lemberg,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_288" id="Page_288">288</a></span>
but appeared suddenly, with dazzling magnificence,
in Warsaw (October, 1759), aroused the curiosity
of the Polish capital, and requested the favor that
the king would stand godfather to him. The newspapers
of the Polish capital were full of accounts of
the daily baptisms of so many Jews, and of the
names of the great nobles and ladies who were their
godparents. But the Church could not rejoice in
her victory. Frank was watched with suspicion by
the clergy. They did not trust him, and suspected
him to be a swindler who, under the mask of Christianity,
as formerly under that of Islam, desired to
play a part as the leader of a sect. The more
Frank reiterated the demand that a special tract of
country be assigned to him, the more he aroused
the suspicion that he was pursuing selfish aims and
that baptism had been but a means to an end.
The Talmud Jews neglected nothing to furnish
proofs of his impostures. At length he was unmasked
and betrayed by some of his Polish followers,
who were incensed at being neglected for the foreign
Frankists, and showed that with him belief in Christianity
was but a farce, and that he had commanded
his followers to address him as Messiah and God
Incarnate and Holy Lord. He was arrested and
examined by the president of the Polish Inquisition
as an impostor and a blasphemer. The depositions
of the witnesses clearly revealed his frauds, and he
was conveyed to the fortress of Czenstochow and
confined in a convent (March, 1760). Only the fact
that the king was his godfather saved Frank from
being burnt at the stake as a heretic and apostate.
His chief followers were likewise arrested and
thrown into prison. The rank and file were in part
condemned to work on the fortifications of Czenstochow,
and partly outlawed. Many Frankists
were obliged to beg for alms at the church doors,
and were treated with contempt by the Polish population.
They continued true, however, to their<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_289" id="Page_289">289</a></span>
Messiah or Holy Lord. All adverse events they
accounted for in the Kabbalistic manner: they had
been divinely predestined. The cloister of Czenstochow
they named mystically, "The gate of
Rome." Outwardly they adhered to the Catholic
religion, and joined in all the sacraments, but they
associated only with each other, and like their Turkish
comrades, the Donm√§h, intermarried only with
each other. The families descended from them in
Poland, Wolowski, Dembowski, Dzalski, are still at
the present day known as Frenks or Sh√§bs. Frank
was set at liberty by the Russians, after thirteen
years' imprisonment in the fortress, played the part
of impostor for over twenty years elsewhere, in
Vienna, Br√ºnn, and at last in Offenbach; set up his
beautiful daughter Eva as the incarnate Godhead,
and deceived the world until the end of his life, and
even after his death; but with this part of his career
Jewish history has nothing to do.</p>

<p>For all these calamitous events, Jonathan Eibesch√ºtz
was in some measure to blame. The Frankists
regarded him, the great Gaon, as one of themselves,
and he did nothing to clear himself from the
stigma of this suspicion. He was implored to aid
the Polish Jews, to make his influence felt in refuting
the charge of the use of Christian blood. He remained
silent as if he feared to provoke the Frankists
against himself. Some of his followers who had
warmly upheld him began to distrust him, among
them Ezekiel Landau, at that time chief rabbi of
Prague. Jacob Emden had won the day, he could
flourish over him the scourge of his scorn; and he
pursued him even beyond the grave as the most
abandoned being who had ever disgraced Judaism.
The rabbinate had placed itself in the pillory, and
undermined its own authority. But it thereby
loosened the soil from which a better seed could
spring forth.</p>

<p>Whilst Eibesch√ºtz and his opponents were squabbling<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_290" id="Page_290">290</a></span>
over amulets and Sabbatian heresy, and Jacob
Frank Lejbowicz was carrying on his Zoharistic
frauds, Mendelssohn and Lessing were cementing
a league of friendship, Portugal was extinguishing
its funeral fires for the Marranos, and in England
the question of the emancipation of the Jews was
being seriously discussed in Parliament.</p>

<p>Can "a nation be born at once"&mdash;or can a people
be regenerated? If the laboriously constructed
organism of a nation has lost vitality, if the bonds
connecting the individual parts are weakened, and
internal dissolution has set in, even the despotic
will which keeps the members in a mechanical union
being wanting; in short, if death comes upon a
commonalty in its corporate state, and it has been
entombed, can it be resuscitated and undergo a revival?
This doom has overtaken many nationalities
of ancient and modern times. But if in such a
people a new birth should take place, <i>i.e.</i>, a resurrection
from death and apparent decomposition, and
if this should occur in a race long past its youthful
vigor, whose history has spread over thousands of
years,&mdash;then such a miracle deserves the most attentive
consideration from every man who does not
stolidly overlook what is marvelous.</p>

<p>The Jewish race has displayed miraculous phenomena,
not only in ancient days, the age of miracles,
but also in this matter-of-fact epoch. A community
which was an object of mockery not merely<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_292" id="Page_292">292</a></span>
to the malicious and ignorant, but almost more to
benevolent and cultured men; despicable in its own
eyes; admirable only by reason of its domestic virtues
and ancient memories, both, however, disfigured
beyond recognition by trivial observances; scourging
itself with bitter irony; of which a representative
member could justly remark, "My nation has become
so estranged from culture, that the possibility
of improvement is doubtful"&mdash;this community
nevertheless raised itself from the dust! It revived
with marvelous rapidity from its abjection, as if a
prophet had called unto it, "Shake thyself from the
dust; arise ... loose thyself from the bands
of thy neck, O captive daughter of Zion!" And
who caused this revival? One man, Moses Mendelssohn,
who may be considered the incarnation
of his race&mdash;stunted in form, awkward, timid, stuttering,
ugly, and repulsive in appearance. But
within this race-deformity breathed a thoughtful
spirit, which only when misled pursued chimeras,
and lost its self-esteem only when proscribed. No
sooner did it understand that it was the exponent
of the truth, than it dismissed its visionary fancies,
its spirit transfigured the body, and raised the bent
form erect, the hateful characteristics disappeared,
and the scornful nickname of "Jew" was changed
almost into a title of honor.</p>

<p>This rejuvenescence or renaissance of the Jewish
race, which may be unhesitatingly ascribed to Mendelssohn,
is noteworthy, inasmuch as the originator
of this great work neither intended nor suspected
it; in fact, as already remarked, he almost doubted
the capacity for rejuvenescence in his brethren. He
produced this altogether unpremeditated glorious
result not by means of his profession or his public
position. He was not a preacher in the wilderness,
who urged the lost sons of Israel to a change of
mind; all his life he shrank from direct exercise of
influence. Even when sought after, he avoided<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_293" id="Page_293">293</a></span>
leadership of every kind with the oft-repeated confession,
that he was in no way fitted for the office.
Mendelssohn played an influential part without
either knowing or desiring it: involuntarily, he
aroused the slumbering genius of the Jewish race,
which only required an impulse to free itself from
its constrained position and develop. The story
of his life is interesting, because it typifies the history
of the Jews in recent times, when they raised themselves
from lowliness and contempt to greatness
and self-consciousness.</p>

<p>Moses Mendelssohn (born at Dessau, August,
1728, died in Berlin, January 4, 1786) was as insignificant
and wretched an object as almost all poor
Jewish children. At this time even infants seemed
to possess a servile appearance. For quick-witted
boys there was no period of youth; they were early
made to shiver and shake by the icy breath of
rough life. They were thus prematurely awakened
to think, and hardened for their struggle with unlovely
reality. One day Mendelssohn, a weakly,
deformed lad in his fourteenth year, knocked at the
door in one of the gates of Berlin. A Jewish
watchman, a sort of police officer, the terror of immigrant
Jews, who was ordered to refuse admission
to those without means of subsistence, harshly addressed
the pale, crippled boy seeking admission.
Fortunately, he managed bashfully to stammer out
that he desired to enroll himself among the Talmudical
pupils of the new rabbi of Berlin. This was a
kind of recommendation, and enabled him to dispense
with a full purse. Mendelssohn was admitted,
and directed his steps towards the house of the
rabbi, David Fr√§nkel, his countryman and teacher,
who had shortly before been called from Dessau to
the rabbinate of Berlin.</p>

<p>He took an interest in the shy youth, allowed
him to attend his rabbinical lectures, provided for
his maintenance, and employed him in copying his<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_294" id="Page_294">294</a></span>
Commentary to the Jerusalem Talmud, because
Mendelssohn had inherited a beautiful handwriting
as his only legacy from his father, a writer of scrolls
of the Law. Even if Mendelssohn learnt from
Fr√§nkel nothing besides the Talmud, yet the latter
exerted a favorable influence upon the mind of his
disciple, because his method, exercising itself upon
virgin soil, the Jerusalem Talmud, was not so distorted,
hair-splitting, and perverse as that of most
expounders of the Talmud, who made the crooked
straight, and the straight crooked. Mendelssohn's
innate honesty and yearning for truth were not suppressed
or hindered by his first teacher, and this
was of value.</p>

<p>Like the majority of Talmud disciples (Bachurim)
Mendelssohn led the life of poverty which the
Talmud in a measure makes a stipulation for
<span class="locked">study:&mdash;</span></p>

<blockquote>

<p>"Eat bread with salt, drink water by measure, sleep upon the hard
earth, live a life of privations, and busy thyself with the Law."</p></blockquote>

<p class="in0">His ideal at this time was to perfect himself in the
knowledge of the Talmud. Was it chance that implanted
in Berlin the seed destined to produce
such luxuriant fruit? Or would the result have
been the same, if he had remained with Fr√§nkel in
Dessau, or if the latter had been called to Halberstadt,
or F√ºrth, or Metz, or Frankfort? It is highly
improbable. Retired though Mendelssohn's life was,
yet a fresh breeze was wafted from the Prussian
capital into the narrow chambers of his Rabbinical
studies. With the accession of Frederick the
Great, who besides war cultivated the Muses
(though in a French garb), literary dilettanteism,
French customs, and contempt for religion began
to grow into fashion among Berlin Jews. Although
their condition under Frederick was restricted, yet,
because several became wealthy, the new spirit did
not pass over them without leaving an impression,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_295" id="Page_295">295</a></span>
however inadequate and superficial. An impulse
towards culture, the spirit of innovation, and imitation
of Christian habits began to manifest themselves.</p>

<p>A Pole first introduced Mendelssohn to the philosophical
work of Maimuni, which for him and
through him became a "Guide of the Perplexed."
The spirit of the great Jewish thinker, whose ashes
had lain in Palestine for more than five hundred
years, came upon young Mendelssohn, inspired him
with fresh thoughts, and made him, as it were, his
Elisha. What signified to Mendelssohn the long
interval of many centuries? He listened to the
words of Maimuni as if sitting at his feet, and imbibed
his wise instruction in deep draughts. He
read this book again and again, until he became
bent by constant perusal of its pages. From the
Pole, Israel Zamosc, he also learned mathematics
and logic, and from Aaron Solomon Gumpertz a
liking for good literature. Mendelssohn learned to
spell and to philosophize at the same time, and received
only desultory assistance in both. He principally
taught and educated himself. He cultivated
firmness of character, tamed his passions, and accustomed
himself, even before he knew what
wisdom was, to live according to her rules. In this
respect also Maimuni was his instructor. By nature
Mendelssohn was violent and hot-tempered; but
he taught himself such complete self-mastery that,
a second Hillel, he became distinguished for meekness
and gentleness.</p>

<p>As if Mendelssohn divined it to be his mission to
purify the morals and elevate the minds of his
brethren, he, still a youth, contributed to a Hebrew
newspaper, started by associates in sympathy with
him for the purpose of ennobling the Jews. The
firstlings of his intellect are like succulent grass in
the early spring. He abandoned the ossified, distorted,
over-embellished Hebrew style of his contemporaries,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_296" id="Page_296">296</a></span>
which had debased the Hebrew language
into the mere mumbling of a decrepit tongue.
Fresh and clear as a mountain-stream the Hebrew
outpourings of Mendelssohn welled forth. Philosophical-religious
views pervaded these early works,
not only where he desired to depict trust in God
and the inefficacy of evil, but also the rejuvenescence
of nature in her spring vesture, and the
delight of the pure mind of man at this beautiful
change. The school of suffering through which he
had passed for so many years, instead of dragging
him down, had awakened, elevated, and ennobled
his spirit. His struggles for a livelihood ceased
when he obtained the situation as tutor in a rich
family (that of Isaac Bernard), which, though not
over-lucrative, sufficed for his frugal habits. His
journeyman days were, however, not yet at an end.
The old and the new, tradition and original views
agitated his mind; clearness and self-consciousness
were to flow into it from another source.</p>

<p>To the great minds which Germany produced in
the eighteenth century belongs Gotthold Ephraim
Lessing. He was the first free-thinking man in
Germany, probably more so than the royal hero
Frederick, who had indeed liberated himself from
bigotry, but still had idols to whom he sacrificed.
With his gigantic mind, Lessing burst through all
bounds and regulations which depraved taste, dry-as-dust
science, haughty orthodoxy, and pedantry
of every kind had desired to set up and perpetuate.
The freedom that Lessing brought to the Germans
was more solid and permanent than that which
Voltaire aroused in depraved French society with
his biting sarcasm; for, his purpose was to ennoble,
and his wit was only a means to this end. Lessing
wished to exalt the theatre to a pulpit, and art to
a religion. Voltaire degraded philosophy into light
gossip for the drawing-room.</p>

<p>It was an important moment for the history of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_297" id="Page_297">297</a></span>
the Jews, when these two young men, Mendelssohn
and Lessing, became acquainted. It is related that
a passionate lover of chess, named Isaac Hess,
brought them together at the chess-board (1754).
The royal game united two monarchs in the kingdom
of thought. Lessing, the son of a pastor, was
of a democratic nature: he sought the society of
outcasts, and those despised by public opinion. As
shortly before he had mixed with actors in Leipsic,
and as afterwards he associated with soldiers in
Breslau, so now he was not ashamed to converse in
Berlin with despised Jews. He had before this
dedicated the first-fruits of his art, which to him appeared
the highest art, to the pariah nation. By
his drama, "The Jews," he desired to show that a
Jew can be unselfish and noble, and he thereby
aroused the displeasure of cultivated Christian circles.
The ideal of a noble Jew which Lessing had in
mind while composing this drama, he saw realized
in Mendelssohn, and it must have pleased him to
find that he was not mistaken in his portraiture,
and that reality did not disprove his dream.</p>

<p>As soon as Lessing and Mendelssohn became
acquainted, they learned to respect and love each
other. The latter admired in his Christian friend
his ability and unconstraint, his courage and perfect
culture, his overflowing spirit, and the vigor which
enabled him to bear a new world upon his broad
shoulders; and Lessing admired in Mendelssohn
nobility of thought, a yearning for truth, and firmness
of character based upon a moral nature. They
were both so imbued with lofty nobility of mind
that the one prized in the other whatever perfection
he could not attain to equally with his friend.
Lessing suspected in his Jewish friend "a second
Spinoza, who would do honor to his nation." Mendelssohn
was completely enchanted by Lessing's
friendship. A friendly look from him, he confessed,
had such power over his mind that it banished all<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_298" id="Page_298">298</a></span>
grief. They exerted perceptible influence upon
each other. Lessing, at that time a mere "Sch√∂ngeist,"
as it was termed, aroused in Mendelssohn
an interest for noble forms, √¶sthetic culture, poetry,
and art; the latter in return stimulated Lessing to
philosophical thought. Thus they reciprocally gave
and received, the true relationship in a worthy
friendship. The bond of amity became so strong,
and united the two friends so sincerely, that it lasted
beyond the grave.</p>

<p>The stimulus that Mendelssohn received from his
friend was extraordinarily fruitful both for him and
for the Jews. It maybe said without exaggeration
that Lessing's influence was greater in ennobling
the Jewish race than in elevating the German people,
due to the fact that the Jews were more eager
for study and more susceptible to culture. All that
Mendelssohn gained by intercourse with his friend
benefited Judaism. Through his friend, who by
reason of a genial, sympathetic nature exerted
great attraction upon talented men, Mendelssohn
was introduced into his circle, learned the forms of
society, and threw off the awkwardness which was
the stamp of the Ghetto. He now devoted himself
zealously to the acquisition of an attractive German
style&mdash;a difficult task, as the German language was
strange to him, and the German vocabulary in use
among Jews was antiquated and misleading. Nor
had he any pattern to follow; for, before Lessing
enriched German style with his genius, it was unwieldy,
rugged, and ungraceful. But Mendelssohn
overcame all difficulties. He withdrew, as he expressed
it, "a portion of his love from the worthy
matron (philosophy), to bestow it upon a wanton
maiden (the so-called <i>belles-lettres</i>.)" Before a
year's intimacy with Lessing elapsed, he was able
to compose in excellent form his "Philosophical
Conversations" (the beginning of 1755), in which
he, the Jew, blamed the Germans, because, misapprehending<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_299" id="Page_299">299</a></span>
the depth of their own genius, they
bore the yoke of French taste: "Will, then, the
Germans never recognize their own worth? Will
they always exchange their gold for the tinsel of
their neighbors?" This rebuke was applicable
even to the philosophical monarch Frederick II,
who could not sufficiently scorn native talent, nor
sufficiently admire that of foreign lands. The Jew
was more German than most of the Germans of
his time.</p>

<p>His patriotic feelings for Judaism did not suffer
diminution thereby; they were united in his heart
with love for German ideals. Although he could
never overcome his dislike to Spinoza's revolutionary
system, yet in his first work he strove to save
the latter's birthright in the new metaphysics. The
"Philosophical Conversations" Mendelssohn handed
to his friend, with the jesting remark that he could
produce something like Shaftesbury, the Englishman.
Without his knowledge Lessing had them
printed, and thus contributed the first leaves to his
friend's crown of laurel. Through Lessing's zeal to
advance him in every way, Mendelssohn became
known in the learned circle in Berlin. When a
"Coffee-house of the Learned," for an association
of about one hundred men of science, was established
in the Prussian capital, hitherto deficient in literary
interests, the founders did not pass over the young
Jewish philosopher, but invited him to join them.
Every month some member delivered a discourse
upon a scientific subject. Mendelssohn, however,
was prevented from reading in public by modesty
and an imperfection of speech; he presented his
contribution in writing. His essay was called an
"Inquiry into Probability," which must replace certainty
in the limited sphere of human knowledge.
While it was being read aloud, he was recognized
as the author, and was applauded by the critical
audience. Thus Mendelssohn was made a citizen<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_300" id="Page_300">300</a></span>
in the republic of literature, took an active part in
the literary productions of the day, and contributed
to the "Library of the Fine Arts," which had been
founded by his friend Nicolai. His taste became
more refined every day, his style grew nobler, and
his thoughts more lucid. His method of presentation
was the more attractive because he seasoned it
with incisive wit.</p>

<p>That which the Jews had lost through the abasement
of thousand years of slavery, Mendelssohn
now recovered for them in a short space of time.
Almost all, with the exception of a few Portuguese
and Italian Jews, had lost pure speech, the first
medium of intellectual intercourse, and a childish
jargon had been substituted, which, a true companion
of their misfortunes, appeared unwilling to
forsake them. Mendelssohn felt disgust at the utter
neglect of language. He saw that the Jewish corrupt
speech contributed not a little to the "immorality
of the average man," and he hoped for good
results from the attention beginning to be paid to
pure language. It was one of the consequences of
the debasement of language, that the German and
Polish Jews had lost all sense of form, taste for
artistic beauty, and √¶sthetic feeling. Oppression
from without and their onerous duties, which had
reduced them to veritable slaves, had banished from
their midst these, together with many other, ennobling
influences. Mendelssohn recovered these lost
treasures for his brethren. He acquired so remarkable
a sense for the beautiful, that he was afterwards
recognized by the Germans as a judge in questions
of taste. The perverse course of study pursued by
the Jews since the fourteenth century had blunted
their minds to simplicity. They had grown so
accustomed to all that was artificial, distorted, super-cunningly
wrought, and to subtleties, that the simple,
unadorned truth became worthless, if not childish
and ridiculous, in their eyes. Their train of thought<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_301" id="Page_301">301</a></span>
was mostly perverted, uncultivated, and defiant of
logical discipline. He who in a short time was to
restore their youthful strength, so schooled himself
that twisted methods and thoughts became repugnant
to him. With his refined appreciation for the
simple, the beautiful, and the true, he acquired a
profound understanding of biblical literature, whose
essence is simplicity and truth. Through the close
layers of musty rubbish, with which commentaries
and super-commentaries had encumbered it, he penetrated
to the innermost core, and was able to
cleanse the beautiful picture from dust, and to understand
and render comprehensible the ancient Revelation
as if it were a new one. Though not gifted
with the ability of expressing his thoughts poetically
or rhythmically, he had a delicate perception of the
poetic beauties of every literature, especially of those
in the holy language. And what formed the crowning-point
of these attainments was, that his moral
views were characterized by extreme delicacy; he
was painfully conscientious and truthful, as if there
flowed through his veins the blood of a long series
of noble ancestors, who had chosen for their life's
task all that is honorable and worthy. Almost
childlike modesty adorned him, modesty quite remote
however from self-despising subservience.
He combined in himself so many innate and hardly
acquired qualities, that he formed a striking contrast
to the caricatures which German and Polish Jews
of the time presented. There was but one feeling
wanting in Mendelssohn&mdash;and this deficiency was
detrimental to the near future of Judaism. He
lacked an appreciation for history, for things petty
on close view, but great in perspective, for the comic
and tragic course of the human race during the
progress of time. "What do I know of history!"
he observed, in half-apologetic, half-scornful tones;
"whatever is called history, political history, history
of philosophers, I cannot understand." He shared<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_302" id="Page_302">302</a></span>
this deficiency with his prototype Maimuni, and
infected his surroundings with it.</p>

<p>Some of his brilliant qualities shone out from
Mendelssohn's eyes and features, and won him more
hearts than if he had striven to gain them. Curiosity
about "this Jew" began to be aroused even at the
court of Frederick the Great. He was considered
the embodiment of wisdom. The dauntless Lessing
infused such courage into him, that he ventured to
criticise in a periodical the poetical works of the Prussian
sovereign, and gently hint at their faults (1760).
Frederick the Great, who regarded verse-making
as poetry, and dogmatism as philosophy, worshiped
the Muse in the court language of the day, thoroughly
despised the German tongue, at this time
pregnant with real poetry, and mocked at intellectual
treasures sacred to solid thinkers. Mendelssohn,
the Jew, felt hurt at the king's hatred of German, as
well as by his superficial judgments. However, as
one dare not tell the truth to monarchs, he cleverly,
through the trumpet of praise, emitted a soft note
of blame, clear enough to the acute reader.</p>

<p>Skillfully as Mendelssohn had concealed his censure
of the king, yet a malicious courtier, the
preacher Justi, discovered it, and also the name of
the fault-finder, and denounced him, "a Jew, who
had thrown aside all reverence for the most sacred
person of His Majesty in insolent criticism of his
poetry." Suddenly, Mendelssohn received a harsh
command to appear on a Saturday at Sans-Souci;
an act in accordance with the coarseness of the age.
Full of dread, Mendelssohn made his way to Potsdam
to the royal castle, was examined, and asked
whether he was the author of the disrespectful criticism.
He admitted his offense, and excused himself
with the observation, that "he who makes
verses, plays at nine-pins, and he who plays at nine-pins,
be he monarch or peasant, must be satisfied
with the judgment of the boy who has charge of the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_303" id="Page_303">303</a></span>
bowls as to the merit of his playing." Frederick
was no doubt ashamed to punish the Jewish reviewer
for his subtle criticism in the presence of the French
cynics of his court, and thus Mendelssohn escaped
untouched.</p>

<p>Fortune was extraordinarily favorable to this
man, unwittingly the chief herald of the future. It
gave him warm friends, who found true delight in
exalting him, though a Jew, in public opinion. It
secured for him a not brilliant, yet fairly independent
situation as book-keeper in the house where
he had hitherto held the toilsome position of resident
tutor. It bestowed on him a trusty, tender,
and simple life companion, who surrounded him
with tokens of devoted love. Fortune soon procured
a great triumph for him. The Berlin Academy
had offered a prize for an essay upon the
subject, "Are philosophical (metaphysical) truths
susceptible of mathematical demonstration?"
Modestly Mendelssohn set to work to solve this
problem. He did not belong to the guild of the
learned, had not learnt his alphabet until grown up,
at an age when conventionally educated youths
have their heads crammed with Latin. When he
became aware that his friend, the young, highly-promising
scholar Thomas Abt, was also a competitor,
he almost lost courage, and desired to withdraw.
Still his work gained the prize (June, 1763),
not alone over Abt, but even over Kant, whose
essay received only honorable mention. Mendelssohn
obtained the prize of fifty ducats and the
medal. The Jew, the tradesman, had defeated his
rivals of the learned guild. Kant's disquisition
went deeper into the question, but that of Mendelssohn
had the advantage of clearness and comprehensibility.
"He had torn the thorns from the
roses of philosophy." Compelled to acquire each
item of his knowledge by great labor, and having
only with difficulty become conversant with the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_304" id="Page_304">304</a></span>
barbarous dialect of the schools, he did not content
himself with dry formul√¶, but exerted himself to
render intelligible, both for himself and others,
metaphysical conceptions and truths. This circumstance
gained him the victory over his much profounder
opponent. His essay, which together with
that of Kant was translated into French and Latin
at the expense of the Academy, earned for him assured
renown in the learned world, which was
enhanced by the fact that the prize-winner was a
Jew.</p>

<p>In the same year (October, 1763), he received a
distinction from King Frederick, characteristic of
the low condition of the Jews in Prussia. This
honor was the privilege of being a protected Jew
(Schutz-Jude), <i>i. e.</i>, the assurance that he would not
some fine day be expelled from Berlin. Hitherto,
he had been tolerated in Berlin only as a retainer
of his employer. The philosophical King Frederick
sympathized with the antipathy of his illustrious
enemy Maria Theresa to the Jews, and issued anti-Jewish
laws worthy of the Middle Ages rather than
of the eighteenth century, so boastful of its humanity.
He wished to see the Jews of his dominions
diminished in number, rather than increased.
Frederick's "general privilege" for the Jews was
an insult to the age. Marquis d'Argent, one of
Frederick's French courtiers, who in his na√Øvet√©
could not conceive that a wise and learned man like
Mendelssohn might any day become liable to be
driven out of Berlin by the brutal police, urged
Mendelssohn to sue for the privilege of protection,
and the king to grant it. However, a long time
elapsed before the dry official document granting it
reached him. At last Mendelssohn became a
Prussian "Schutz-Jude."</p>

<p>The philosophical "Schutz-Jude" of Berlin now
won great success with a work, which met with almost
rapturous admiration from his contemporaries<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_305" id="Page_305">305</a></span>
in all classes of society. Two decades later this
production was already obsolete, and at the present
day has only literary value. Nevertheless, when it
appeared, it justly attained great importance.
Mendelssohn had hit upon the exact moment to
bring it forward, and he became one of the celebrities
of the eighteenth century. For almost sixteen
centuries Christianity had educated the nations
of Europe, governed them, and almost surfeited
them with belief in the supernatural. It had employed
all available means to effect its ends, and
finally, when the thinkers awakened from their
slumber induced by its lullabies, to inquire into the
certainty secured by this announcement of salvation
which promised so much, serious people said
with regret&mdash;whilst sceptics chuckled with brutal
delight&mdash;that it offered delusive fancies in the place
of truth.</p>

<p>In serious compositions, or in satires, the French
thinkers of the eighteenth century&mdash;the whole body
of Materialists&mdash;had revealed the hollowness of the
doctrine, in which the so-called civilized peoples
had found comfort and tranquillity for many centuries.
The world was deprived of a God, the
heavens were enshrouded in mist; all that had
hitherto seemed firm and incapable of being displaced
was turned topsy-turvy. The doctrine of
Jesus had lost its power of attraction, and become
degraded in the eyes of the earnest and thoughtful
to the level of childish fables. Infidelity had become
a fashion. With the undeifying of Jesus
appeared to go hand-in-hand the dethronement of
God, and doubt of the important dogma of the immortality
of the soul, which Christian theology had
borrowed from Greek philosophy and, as always,
adorning itself with strange feathers, had claimed
as its original creation. Thereupon depended not
merely the confidence of mankind in a future existence,
but also the practical morals of the present.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_306" id="Page_306">306</a></span>
If the soul is mortal and transient, they thought in
the eighteenth century, then the acts of man are of
no consequence! Whether he be good or evil,
virtuous or criminal, on the other side of the grave
there was no retribution. Thus, after the long
dream of many centuries, the civilized portion of
mankind again fell into the despondency prevalent
in the Roman society of the empire; they were
without God, without support, without moral freedom,
without stimulus to a virtuous life. Man had
been degraded to a complicated machine.</p>

<p>Mendelssohn was also biased by the prejudice
that the dignity of man stands and falls with the
question of the immortality of the soul. He therefore
undertook to restore this belief to the cultured
world, to discover again the lost truth, to establish
it so firmly and ward off materialistic attacks upon
it so decisively, that the dying man should calmly
look forward to a blissful future and to felicity in
the after-life. He composed a dialogue called
"Ph√¶don, or the Immortality of the Soul." It was
to be a popular book, a new doctrine of salvation
for the unbelieving or sceptical world. Therefore
he gave to his dialogue an easily comprehensible,
attractive style, after the pattern of Plato's dialogue
of the same name, from which he copied also the
external form. But Plato supplied him with the
mere form. Mendelssohn caused his Socrates to
give utterance to the philosophy of the eighteenth
century through the mouth of his pupil, Ph√¶don.</p>

<p>His starting-point, in proving the doctrine of the
immortality of the soul, is the fact of the existence
of God, of which he has the highest possible certainty.
The soul is the work of God, just as the
body is; the body does not actually perish after
dissolution, but is transformed into other elements;
much less, then, can the soul, a simple essence, be
decomposed, and perish. Further, God has acquainted
the soul with the idea of immortality, has<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_307" id="Page_307">307</a></span>
implanted it in the soul. Can He, the Benevolent
and True One, practice deception?</p>

<blockquote>

<p>"If our soul were mortal, then reason would be a dream, which
Jupiter has sent us that we may forget our misery; and we would be
created like the beasts, only to seek food and die."</p></blockquote>

<p class="in0">Every thought inborn in man must for that reason
be true and real.</p>

<p>In demonstrating the doctrine of immortality,
Mendelssohn had another noble purpose in view.
He thought to counteract the malady of talented
youths of the day, the Jerusalem-Werthers, who,
without a goal for their endeavors, excluded from
political and elevating public activity, lost in whimsical
sentimentality and self-created pain, sank to
thoughts of suicide, which they carried out, unless
courage, too, was sicklied over. Mendelssohn,
therefore, in his "Ph√¶don" sought to inculcate the
conviction, that man, with his immortal soul, is a possession
of God, and has no manner of right to decide
arbitrarily about himself and his life, or about the
separation of his soul from his body&mdash;feeble argumentation,
but sufficient for that weakly, effeminate
generation.</p>

<p>With his "Ph√¶don," Mendelssohn attained more
than he had intended and expected, viz., "conviction
of the heart, warmth of feeling," in favor of the doctrine
of immortality. "Ph√¶don" was the most popular
book of its time, and was perused with heart
and soul. In two years it ran through three editions,
and was immediately translated into all the European
languages, also into Hebrew. Theologians,
philosophers, artists, poets, such as Herder, Gleim,
and Goethe, then but a youth, statesmen, and princes&mdash;men
and women&mdash;were edified by it, reanimated
their depressed religious courage, and, with an enthusiasm
which would to-day appear absurd, thanked
the Jewish sage who had restored to them that
comfort which Christianity no longer afforded. The<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_308" id="Page_308">308</a></span>
deliverance by Mendelssohn, the Jew, was as joyfully
welcomed by the world grown pagan, as in
an earlier epoch that effected by the Jews, Jesus and
Paul of Tarsus, was welcomed by the heathens.
His contemporaries were delighted both with the
contents and the form, with the glowing, fresh, vigorous
style, a happy, artistic imitation of Plato's
dialogues. From all sides letters of congratulation
poured in upon the modest author. Everyone of
the literary guild who passed through Berlin eagerly
sought out the Jewish Plato, as one of the greatest
celebrities of the Prussian capital, to have a word
with him. The Duke of Brunswick seriously thought
of securing the services of Mendelssohn for his
state. The Prince of Lippe-Schaumburg treated
him as a bosom friend. The Berlin Academy of
Sciences proposed him as a member. But King
Frederick struck the name of Mendelssohn off the
list, because, as it was said, he desired at the same
time to have the Empress Catherine admitted into
the learned body, and she would be insulted in having
a Jew as a companion. Two Benedictine friars&mdash;one
from the convent of Peter, near Erfurt, the
other from the convent of La Trappe&mdash;addressed
Mendelssohn, the Jew, as the adviser of their conscience,
for instruction in moral and philosophical
conduct. The book "Ph√¶don," out of date in twenty
years, as remarked above, raised its author to the
height of fame. He was fortunate, because he introduced
it to the world exactly at the right moment.</p>

<p>An incident vexatious in itself served to exalt
Mendelssohn to an extraordinary degree in the eyes
of his contemporaries, and to invest him with the
halo of martyrdom. John Caspar Lavater, an
evangelical minister of Z√ºrich, an enthusiast who
afterwards joined the Jesuits, thought that he had
found in Mendelssohn's intellectual countenance a
confirmation of his deceptive art, the reading of the
character and talents of a man from his features.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_309" id="Page_309">309</a></span>
Lavater asserted that in every line of Mendelssohn's
face the unprejudiced could at once recognize the
soul of Socrates. He was completely enchanted
with Mendelssohn's head, raved about it, desiring
to possess a well-executed model, in order to bring
honor upon his art. Mendelssohn having caused his
Ph√¶don to speak in so Greek a fashion that no one
could have recognized the author as a Jew, Lavater
arrived at the fantastic conclusion that Mendelssohn
had become entirely estranged from his religion.
Lavater had learned that certain Berlin Jews were
indifferent to Judaism, and forthwith reckoned Mendelssohn
amongst their number. There was the
additional fact that, in a conversation reluctantly
entered upon with Lavater, Mendelssohn had pronounced
calm, sober judgment upon Christianity,
and had spoken with a certain respect of Jesus,
though with the reservation, "if Jesus of Nazareth
had desired to be considered only a virtuous man."
This expression appeared to Lavater the dawning
of grace and belief. What if this great man, this
incarnation of wisdom, who had become indifferent
towards Judaism, could be won over to Christianity!
This was the train of thought which arose in Lavater's
mind after reading "Ph√¶don." Ingenuous or
cunning, he spread his net for Mendelssohn, and
thus showed how ignorant he was of his true character.
About this time, a Geneva professor, Caspar
Bonnet, had written in French a weak apology, entitled
"Investigation into the Evidences of Christianity
against Unbelievers." This work Lavater
translated into German, and sent to Mendelssohn,
with an awkward dedication, which looked like a
snare (September 4, 1769). Lavater solemnly adjured
him to refute publicly Bonnet's proofs of
Christianity, or, if he found them correct, to do
"what sagacity, love of truth, and honesty would
naturally dictate, what a Socrates would have done,
if he had read this treatise, and found it unanswerable."<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_310" id="Page_310">310</a></span>
If Lavater had been really acquainted with
the secrets of the heart, as he prided himself, he
would have understood that, even if Mendelssohn
had severed all connection with Judaism, Christianity
was still more repugnant to him, and that sagacity,
that is to say, regard to profit and the advantages
of a pleasant existence, was altogether lacking in
his character. Lavater did not desire to expose
him before the public, but he wished to create a sensation,
without thinking what pain he was causing
the shy scholar of Berlin.</p>

<p>Mendelssohn later had reason to thank Lavater
for having through thoughtlessness or pious cunning
drawn him out of his diffidence and seclusion. Mendelssohn
had indeed expressed his relations to
Judaism and his co-religionists so vaguely that onlookers
might have been misled. In public life he
was a philosopher and an elegant writer, who represented
the principles of humanity and good taste,
and apparently did not trouble about his race. In
the darkness of the Ghetto he was a strictly orthodox
Jew, who, apparently unconcerned about the
laws of beauty, joined in the observance of every
pious custom. Self-contained and steadfast though
he was in reality, he seemed to be a twofold personality,
revealing the one or the other as he was
in Christian or in Jewish society. He could not
stand up in defense of Judaism without, on the one
hand, affronting Christianity by his philosophical
convictions, and, on the other, showing, if ever so
lightly, his dissatisfaction with the chaotic traditions
of the synagogue, and so offending the sensibility
of his co-religionists and quarreling with them.
Neither of these courses, owing to his peace-loving
character, entered his mind. He would have been
able to pass his life in an attitude of silence, if Lavater's
rude importunity had not dragged him out of
this false position, altogether unworthy of a man
with a mission. Painful as it was to reveal his innermost<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_311" id="Page_311">311</a></span>
thoughts upon Judaism and Christianity, he
could not hold his peace at this challenge, without
being considered a coward even by his friends.
These reflections weighed heavily upon him, and
caused him to take up the glove.</p>

<p>He skillfully carried on the contest thus forced
upon him, and was ultimately victorious. At the
end of 1769, in a public letter addressed to Christendom
and Lavater, its representative, Mendelssohn
in the mildest form wrote most cutting truths,
whose utterance in former times would inevitably
have led to bloodshed or the stake. Mendelssohn
had examined his religion since the days of his
youth, and found it true. Philosophy and <i>belles-lettres</i>
had with him never been an end, but the
means to prepare him for testing Judaism. He
could not possibly expect advantage from adherence
to it; and as for <span class="locked">pleasure&mdash;</span></p>

<blockquote>

<p>"O my worthy friend, the position assigned to my co-religionists
in civil life is so far removed from all free exercise of spiritual powers,
that one's satisfaction is not increased by learning the true rights
of man. He who knows the state in which we now are, and has a
humane heart, will understand more than I can express."</p></blockquote>

<p>If the examination of Judaism had not produced
results favorable to it, what would have chained him
to a religion so intensely and universally despised,
what could have prevented him from leaving it?
Fear of his co-religionists, forsooth? Their secular
power was too insignificant to do any harm.</p>

<blockquote>

<p>"I do not deny that I have noticed in my religion certain human
additions and abuses, such as every religion accepts in course of
time, which unfortunately dim its splendor. But of the essentials of
my faith I am so firmly and indisputably assured, that I call God to
witness that I will adhere to my fundamental creed as long as my
soul does not assume another nature."</p></blockquote>

<p>He was as opposed to Christianity as ever, for
the reason which he had communicated to Lavater
verbally, and which the latter should not have concealed,
namely, that its founder had declared himself
to be God.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_312" id="Page_312">312</a></span></p>

<blockquote>

<p>"Yet, for my part, Judaism might have been utterly crushed in
every polemical text-book, and triumphantly arraigned in every
school composition, without my ever entering into a controversy
about it. Without the slightest contradiction from me, any scholar
or any sciolist in subjects Rabbinic might have constructed for himself
and his readers the most ridiculous view of Judaism out of worthless
books which no rational Jew reads, or knows of. The contemptible
opinion held of Jews I would desire to shame by virtue, not by controversy.
My religion, my philosophy, and my status in civil life are
the weightiest arguments for avoiding all religious discussion, and
for treating in public writings of truths equally important to all
religions."</p></blockquote>

<p>Judaism was binding only upon the congregation
of Jacob. It desired proselytes so little, that the
rabbis had ordained that any person who offered to
unite himself to this religion was to be dissuaded
from his design.</p>

<blockquote>

<p>"The religion of my fathers does not care to be spread abroad;
we are not to send missions to the two Indies or to Greenland, to
preach our belief to remote nations. I have the good fortune to
possess as friends many excellent men not of my creed. We love
each other dearly, and never have I said in my heart, 'What a pity
for that beautiful soul!' It is possible for me to recognize national
prejudices and erroneous religious opinions among my fellow-citizens,
and nevertheless feel constrained to remain silent, if these
errors do not directly affect natural religion or natural law (morality),
but are only accidentally connected with the advancement of good.
It is true that the morality of our actions does not deserve the name,
if based upon error.... But as long as truth is not recognized,
as long as it does not become national, so as to work as powerful an
effect upon the great mass of the people as ingrained prejudice, the
latter must be almost sacred to every friend of virtue. These are the
reasons that religion and philosophy give me to shun religious
disputes."</p></blockquote>

<p>Besides, being a Jew, he had to be content with
toleration, because in other countries even this was
denied his race. "Is it not forbidden, according to
the laws of your native city," he ask Lavater,
"for your circumcised friend even to visit you in
Z√ºrich?" The French work of Bonnet he did not
find so convincing, he said, as to cause his convictions
to waver; he had read better defenses of
Christianity written by Englishmen and Germans;
also it was not original, but borrowed from German
writings. The arguments were so feeble and so<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_313" id="Page_313">313</a></span>
little tending to prove Christianity that any religion
could be equally well or badly defended by them.
If Lavater thought that a Socrates could have been
convinced of the truth of Christianity by this treatise,
he only showed what power prejudice exerts
over reason.</p>

<p>If the evangelical consistory, before whom Mendelssohn
offered to lay his letter for censorship before
printing it, did not regret granting him permission
to print whatever he pleased, "because they
knew his wisdom and modesty to be such that he
would write nothing that might give public offense,"
still he undoubtedly did give offense to many pious
persons.</p>

<p>Mendelssohn's epistle to Lavater naturally made
a great sensation. Since the appearance of Ph√¶don,
he belonged to the select band of authors
whose works every cultivated person felt obliged to
read. Besides it happened that the subject of the
controversy was attractive at the time. The free-thinkers&mdash;by
no means few at this time&mdash;were glad
that at last some one, a Jew at that, had ventured
to utter a candid word about Christianity. Owing
to his obtrusiveness and presumptuous advocacy of
Christianity, Lavater had many enemies. These
read Mendelssohn's clever reply to the zealous conversionist
with mischievous delight. The hereditary
prince of Brunswick, who, as said above, was
charmed with Mendelssohn, expressed (January 2,
1770) his admiration, that he had spoken "with such
great tact and so high a degree of humanitarianism"
upon these nice questions. Bonnet himself, less
objectionable than his servile flatterer, admitted the
justice of Mendelssohn's cause, and complained of
Lavater's injudicious zeal. A letter of his dated
January 12, 1770, was almost a triumph for Mendelssohn.
He said that his dissertation, with which
Lavater had desired to convert the Jew, had not
been addressed to the honorable "House of Jacob,"<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_314" id="Page_314">314</a></span>
for which his heart entertained the sincerest and
warmest wishes; much less had it been his intention
to give the Jewish philosopher a favorable
opinion of Christianity. He was full of admiration
for the wisdom, the moderation, and the abilities of
the famous son of Abraham. He indeed desired
him to investigate Christianity, as it could only gain
by being subjected to a close inquiry by the wise
son of Mendel. But he did not wish to fall into
Lavater's mistakes, and make it burdensome for
him. However, in spite of his virtuous indignation,
Bonnet perpetrated a bit of knavery against Mendelssohn.
Lavater himself was obliged in a letter
to publicly beg Mendelssohn's pardon for having
placed him in so awkward a position, entreating
him at the same time to attest that he had not intentionally
been guilty of any indiscretion or perfidy.
Thus Mendelssohn had an opportunity of
acting magnanimously towards his opponent. On
the subject proper under dispute, however, he remained
firm; he did not surrender an iota of his
Judaism, not even its Talmudical and Rabbinical
peculiarities, and with every step his courage grew.</p>

<p>Mendelssohn did not wish to let pass this propitious
opportunity of glorifying Judaism, which was
so intensely contemned, and make it clear that it
was in no way opposed to reason. Despite the
warnings of timid Jews, to allow the controversy to
lapse, so as not to stir up persecutions, he pointed
out with growing boldness the chasm which Christianity
had dug between itself and reason, whereas
Judaism in its essence was in accord with reason.
"The nearer I approach this so highly-esteemed
religion," he wrote in his examination of Bonnet's
"Paling√©n√©sie," "the more abhorrent is it to my
reason." It afforded him especial delight when
strictly orthodox Christians thought that they were
abusing Judaism by declaring it to be equivalent to
natural religion (Deism).</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_315" id="Page_315">315</a></span></p>

<blockquote>

<p>"Blessed be God, who has given unto us the doctrine of truth. We
have no dogmas contrary to, or beyond reason. We add nothing,
except commandments and statutes, to natural religion; but the fundamental
doctrines of our religion rest upon the basis of understanding."
"This is our glory and our pride, and all the writings of our
sages are full of it."</p></blockquote>

<p>Frankly Mendelssohn spoke to the hereditary
prince of Brunswick of the untenability of Christian,
and the reasonableness of Jewish, dogmas. He
thought that he had not yet done enough for
Judaism.</p>

<blockquote>

<p>"Would to God, another similar opportunity were granted me; I
would do the same.... When I consider what we ought to do for
the recognition of the sanctity of our religion."</p></blockquote>

<p>Those who had not wholly parted company with
reason declared Mendelssohn to be in the right, and
his defense to be just. They beheld with astonishment
that Judaism, so greatly despised, was yet
vastly superior to celebrated, official, orthodox
Christianity. Through its noble son, Judaism celebrated
a triumph. The unhappy ardor of Lavater,
and the refined yet daring answer of Mendelssohn
for a long time formed the topic of conversation in
cultured circles in Germany, and even beyond its
borders. The journals commented upon it, and
noted every incident. Anecdotes passed backwards
and forwards between Z√ºrich and Berlin. It was
said that Lavater had asserted that if he were
able to continue for eleven days in a state of complete
holiness and prayer, he would most positively
succeed in converting Mendelssohn to Christianity.
When Mendelssohn heard this saying&mdash;whether
authentic or not it is characteristic of Lavater&mdash;he
smilingly said, "If I am permitted to sit here in my
armchair and smoke a pipe philosophically, I have
no objections!" There was more talk of the contest
between Mendelssohn and Lavater than of war and
peace. Every fair brought pamphlets written in
German and French, unimportant productions,
which did not deserve to live long. Only a few were<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_316" id="Page_316">316</a></span>
on Mendelssohn's side, the majority took the part
of Christianity and its representatives against the
"insolence of the Jew," who did not consider it an
honor to be offered admission into the Christian
community.</p>

<p>The worst of these was by a petty, choleric
author, named John Balthasar K√∂lbele, of Frankfort-on-the-Main,
who, from hatred of the Jews, or
from distemper of body and soul, hurled such coarse
insults against Mendelssohn, the rabbis, the Jews,
and Judaism, that his very violence paralyzed his
onslaught. K√∂lbele had on a previous occasion
attacked Mendelssohn, and jeered at him by means
of a lay figure in one of his forgotten romances. He
desired to write, or said that he had written, an
"Anti-Ph√¶don" against Mendelssohn's "Ph√¶don."
His whole gall was vented in a letter to "Mr. Mendelssohn
upon the affair of Lavater and K√∂lbele"
(March, 1770). Against the assertions of Mendelssohn
as to the purity of Judaism, he brought forward
the calumnies and perversions of his brother in feeling,
Eisenmenger. Mendelssohn's pure, unselfish
character was known in almost all cultivated and
high circles of Europe. Nevertheless, K√∂lbele cast
the suspicion upon him of adhering to Judaism from
self-interest, "because a Jewish bookkeeper is in a
better position than a Christian professor, and the
former besides derives some profit from attendance
in the antechambers of princes." To Mendelssohn's
asseveration that he would cling to Judaism all his
lifetime, the malignant fool or libeler rejoined,
"How little value Christians attach to the oath of a
Jew!" Mendelssohn disposed of him in a few words
in the postscript of a letter addressed to Lavater.
Nothing more was required; K√∂lbele had condemned
himself. Mendelssohn profited by these
vilifying attacks, inasmuch as respectable authors,
who in their hearts were not a little irritated by his
independent and bold action, left him in peace,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_317" id="Page_317">317</a></span>
rather than be associated with K√∂lbele. Mendelssohn
emerged victorious from this conflict, trifling
only at first sight, which had lasted for nearly two
years; he rose in public opinion, because he had
manfully vindicated his own religion.</p>

<p>It had brought upon him also the reproaches of
pious Jews. That which his discernment had feared
took place. From love of truth he had publicly declared,
that he had found in Judaism certain human
additions and abuses, which only served to dim its
splendor. This expression offended those who reverenced
every custom, however un-Jewish, as a
revelation from Sinai, because it was sanctified by
time and the code. The entire Jewish world, including
the Berlin community, with the exception of
the few who belonged to Mendelssohn's circle,
would not admit that rust had accumulated upon
the noble metal of Judaism. He was therefore
questioned on this point, probably by Rabbi Hirschel
Lewin, and asked for an exact explanation of
the phrase. He was very well able to give a reply,
which probably satisfied the rabbi, who was no
zealot. But his orthodoxy was still suspected by
the strictly pious people whom he termed "the
K√∂lbeles of our co-religionists." He was obliged
to exculpate himself from the imputation of having
pronounced the decisions of Talmudical sages "as
worthless trash." Young Poles, adventurous spirits,
thirsting for knowledge, "with good minds, but
confused thoughts," both pure and impure elements,
forced themselves upon Mendelssohn, and brought
him into bad repute. The majority had broken not
alone with the Talmud, but also with religion and
morality; they led a dissolute life, and considered
it the mark of philosophy and enlightenment. Out
of love to mankind and independent thought, Mendelssohn
entered into relations with them, held discussions
with them, advanced and aided them, which
also cast a false light upon his relations to Judaism.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_318" id="Page_318">318</a></span>
The frivolity and excesses of these young men were
imputed to him, and they were regarded as his
prot√©g√©s and disciples.</p>

<p>He soon gave occasion for an increase of this
suspicion. The Duke of Mecklenburg-Schwerin, to
avoid the dangers of premature interment, had in a
mild, fatherly way (April, 1772) forbidden the Jews
of his land to bury the dead at once, according to
Jewish usage. Jewish piety towards the deceased,
which forbids keeping the dead above the earth
long enough for decomposition to set in&mdash;a feeling
petrified in the ritual code&mdash;was affronted by this
edict, as though the duke had commanded disregard
of a religious practice. The representatives
of the congregations of Schwerin supplicated Jacob
Emden, of Altona, the aged champion of orthodoxy,
to demonstrate from Talmudic and Rabbinic laws,
that prolonged exposure of a corpse was an important
infringement of Jewish law. Emden, who knew
his inability to compose a memorial in German, referred
the people of Schwerin to Mendelssohn,
whose word had great influence with princes.
They followed his advice. How astounded were
they to learn, from a letter of Mendelssohn's (May,
1772), that he agreed with the ducal order, that the
dead should not be buried before the third day; because,
according to the experience of competent
physicians, cases of apparent death were possible;
and that it was right, in fact, compulsory, to rescue
human life in spite of the most stringent ordinances
of the religious code! Mendelssohn proved besides
that in Talmudical times precautions were
taken for the prevention of hasty burial in doubtful
cases. His opinion was, with the exception of one
blunder, faultlessly elaborated in the Rabbinical
manner. Nevertheless, true to his peaceful, complaisant
nature, he sent the formula of a petition to
the duke to mitigate the decree. Emden, however,
in his orthodox zeal, stamped this disputed question<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_319" id="Page_319">319</a></span>
almost as an article of faith. A custom so universal
among Jews, among Italians and Portuguese as
well as Germans and Poles, could not be lightly set
aside. Not much value was to be attached to the
sayings of doctors. Mendelssohn's Talmudical
proofs were not conclusive. In a letter Emden
gave him clearly to understand that he was reproving
him for his own benefit, to remove the suspicion
of lukewarm belief, which he had aroused by his
evil surroundings. Thus arose petty discord between
Mendelssohn and the rigidly orthodox party,
which afterwards increased.</p>

<p>Meanwhile, his friend Lessing, just before his
death, had unintentionally stirred up a storm in
Germany which caused the Church to tremble, and,
under the spell of discontent and an artistic impulse,
he had glorified Mendelssohn, together with
all Jews, in a perfect poetic creation. The first
cause of this tempest, which shook Christianity to
its core, was Mendelssohn's dispute with Lavater.
Lessing was so indignant at the certainty of victory
assumed by the representative of Church Christianity
that he had strenuously encouraged his Jewish
friend to engage in valorous conflict.</p>

<blockquote>

<p>"You alone dare and are able to write and speak thus upon this
matter, and are therefore infinitely more fortunate than all other honest
people, who cannot achieve the subversion of this detestable
structure of unreason otherwise than under the pretense of building a
new substructure."</p></blockquote>

<p>He did not suspect that even then he was holding
a thunderbolt in his hands, which he would soon be in
a position to hurl against the false gods who thought
that they had conquered heaven. During his restless
life, which corresponded to his constantly agitated
spirit, Lessing came to Hamburg, where he
made the acquaintance of the respected and free-thinking
family of Reimarus. Hermann Samuel
Reimarus, a profound inquirer, indignant at the
fossilized and insolent Lutheran Christianity of the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_320" id="Page_320">320</a></span>
Hamburg pastors, had written a "Defense of the
Rational Worshipers of God," in which he rejected
every revealed religion, endeavoring to secure to
reason the rights denied it, and depreciating particularly
the founder of Christianity. Reimarus,
however, had not courage to utter boldly what he
recognized as true, and lay bare publicly, in accordance
with his convictions, the weaknesses of the
dominant religion. He left this treatise, which contained
dangerous and inflammatory material, to his
family and to a secret order of free-thinkers, as a
legacy. Eliza Reimarus, a noble daughter worthy
of her father, handed fragments of this incendiary
manuscript to Lessing, who read them with interest,
and thought of publishing them. However, he had
not sufficient confidence in himself to give a decision
upon points of theological discussion, and, therefore,
sent these fragments to his Jewish friend, who
was capable of judging them. Mendelssohn did
not, indeed, find this work very convincing, because
the author, embittered by the credulity of the
Church, had fallen into the opposite error of advocating
the most spiritless form of infidelity, and, according
to the shortsighted view of that age, of
finding only petty intrigues in great historical movements.
Despite Mendelssohn's judgment, his friend
continued to think that this book would be of service
in humiliating the Church. He seriously
thought of hurling the inflammatory writings of
Reimarus, under a false name, at the Church. But
the Berlin censorship would not allow them to be
printed. Then Lessing formed another plan. His
position as superintendent of the ducal library of
Brunswick in Wolfenb√ºttel permitted him to publish
the manuscript treasures of this rich collection.
In the interest of truth he perpetrated a falsehood,
asserting that he had discovered in this library these
"Fragments of an Unknown," the work of an author
of the last generation. Under this mask, and protected<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_321" id="Page_321">321</a></span>
by his immunity from censorship in publishing
contributions "to history and literature from the
treasures of the library at Wolfenb√ºttel," he began
to issue them. He proceeded step by step with the
publication of these fragments. The first installments
were couched in an entreating tone, asking
for support of the religion of reason against the
religion of the catechism and the pulpit. He then
ventured a step further&mdash;to prove the impossibility
of the miracles upon which the Church was based,
and especially to make apparent the unhistorical
character and incredibility of the resurrection of
Jesus, one of the main pillars of Christianity, with
which it stands and falls. Finally, Lessing produced
the most important of the fragments at the
beginning of 1778, "Upon the Aim of Jesus and
His Disciples." Herein it was explained that Jesus
had only desired to announce himself as the Jewish
Messiah and King of the Jews. To this end he
had made secret preparations with his disciples,
formed conspiracies to kindle a revolution in Jerusalem,
and attacked the authorities in order to cause
the downfall of the High Council (the Synhedrion).
But when this plan of subversion failed, and Jesus
had to suffer death, his disciples invented another
system, and declared that the kingdom of Jesus was
not of this world. They proclaimed him the spiritual
redeemer of mankind, and gave prominence to
the hope of his speedy reappearance; thus the
Apostles had concealed and disfigured the original
system of Jesus.</p>

<p>This treatment of the early history of Christianity,
fairly calculated to overthrow the whole edifice of
the Church, descended like a lightning-flash. It
was sober, convincing, scientifically elaborated, yet
comprehensible by everyone. Amazement and
stupefaction were the effect, especially on the
publication of the last fragment. Statesmen and
citizens were as much affected as theologians.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_322" id="Page_322">322</a></span>
Public opinion upon the matter was divided.
Earnest youths about to begin a theologic career
hesitated; they did not care to yield their life's
activity to what was perhaps only a dream, and
chose another vocation. Some affirmed that the
proofs against Christianity were irrefutable. The
anonymity of the writer heightened the excitement.
Conjectures were made as to who the author might
be; Mendelssohn's name was publicly mentioned.
Only a few knew that this blow had been struck by
Reimarus, revered by theologians, too. The anger
of the zealots was discharged upon the publisher,
Lessing. He was attacked by all parties, and had
no companion in arms. His Jewish friend would
willingly have hastened to his assistance, but how
could he mix himself up in these domestic squabbles
of the Christians? Among the numerous slanders
circulated by the orthodox about Lessing it was
said that the wealthy Jewish community of Amsterdam
had paid him one thousand ducats for the
publication of the Wolfenb√ºttel fragments. Accustomed
to single-handed combat against want of
taste and reason, Lessing was man enough to
protect himself. It was a goodly sight to behold
this giant in the fray, dealing crushing strokes
with light banter and graceful skill. He defeated
his enemies one after the other, especially one who
was the type of blindly credulous, arrogant, and
malicious orthodoxy, the minister G√∂ze in Hamburg.
As his pigmy opponents could not overcome this
Hercules by literary skill, they summoned to their
aid the secular arm. Lessing's productions were
forbidden and confiscated, he was compelled to
deliver up the manuscripts of the "Fragments,"
his freedom from censorship was withdrawn, and
he was expected not to write any more upon this
subject (1778). He struggled against these violent
proceedings, but he was vulnerable in one point.
The greatest man whom Germany had hitherto<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_323" id="Page_323">323</a></span>
produced was without means, and his position as
librarian being imperiled, he was obliged to seek
for other means of support. During one of his
sleepless nights (August 10, 1778), a plan struck
him which would simultaneously relieve him from
pecuniary embarrassments and inflict a worse blow
than ten "Fragments" upon the Lutheran theologians.
They thundered against him from their
church pulpits; he would try to answer them from
his theatre pulpit. The latest, most mature, and
most perfect offspring of his Muse, "Nathan the
Wise," should be his avenger. Lessing had carried
this idea in his mind for several years; but he could
not have executed it at a more favorable time.</p>

<p>To the annoyance of the pious Christians who,
with all their bigotry, uncharitableness, and desire
for persecution, laid claim to every virtue on account
of their belief in Jesus, and denounced the Jews,
one and all, as outcasts, Lessing represented a
Jew as the immaculate ideal of virtue, wisdom,
and conscientiousness. This ideal he had found
embodied in Moses Mendelssohn. He illumined
him and the greatness of his character by the bright
light of theatrical effects, and impressed the stamp
of eternity upon him by his immortal verses. The
chief hero of Lessing's drama is a sage and a
merchant, like Mendelssohn, "as good as he is
clever, and as clever as he is wise." His nation
honors him as a prince, and though it calls him the
wise Nathan, he was above all things good:</p>

<div class="poem-container">
<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="iq">"The law commandeth mercy, not compliance.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And thus for mercy's sake he's uncomplying:<br /></span>
<span class="i0">... How free from prejudice his lofty soul&mdash;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">His heart to every virtue how unlocked&mdash;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">With every lovely feeling how familiar....<br /></span>
<span class="i0">... O what a Jew is he! yet wishes<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Only to pass as a Jew."<br /></span>
</div></div>
</div>

<p>A son of Judaism, Nathan had elevated himself
to the highest level of humane feeling and charitableness,
for such his Law prescribed. In a fanatical<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_324" id="Page_324">324</a></span>
massacre by Crusaders, ferocious Christians had
slaughtered all the Jews in Jerusalem, with their
wives and children, and his beloved wife and seven
hopeful sons had been burnt. At first he raged,
and murmured against fate, but anon he spake with
the patience of Job:</p>

<div class="poem-container">
<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">"This also was God's decree: So be it!"<br /></span>
</div></div>
</div>

<p>In his terrible grief a mounted soldier brought
him a young, tender Christian child, an orphan girl,
and Nathan took it, bore it to his couch, kissed it,
flung himself upon his knees, and thanked God that
the lost seven had been replaced by at least one.
This Christian maiden he loved with all the warmth
of a fatherly heart, and educated her in a strictly
conscientious manner. Not one religion in preference
to another, still less his own, did he instil
into the young soul of Recha, or Blanche, but only
the doctrines of pure fear of God, ideal virtue, and
morality. Such was the representative of Judaism.</p>

<p>How did the representative of Christianity
behave? The Patriarch of Jerusalem, who, with
his church, was tolerated in the Mahometan city by
the magnanimous Sultan Saladin, by virtue of a
solemnly ratified treaty, meditates treacherous plans
against the sultan, concocts intrigues against him:</p>

<div class="poem-container">
<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i8">"But what is villainy in human eyes<br /></span>
<span class="i0">May, in the sight of God, the patriarch thinks,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Not be villainy."<br /></span>
</div></div>
</div>

<p>For Nathan, he desires to kindle a pyre, because
he has fostered, loved, and raised to a lovely,
spiritual maiden, a forsaken Christian child. Without
the compassion of the Jew, the child would have
perished:</p>

<div class="poem-container">
<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">"That's nothing! The Jew must still be burnt."<br /></span>
</div></div>
</div>

<p>Daya, another representative of Church Christianity,
who knows Recha's Christian origin, has
misgivings when she sees the Christian child basking<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_325" id="Page_325">325</a></span>
in the warm love of a Jew. She is won over
from these scruples by costly presents, but she still
contemplates depriving Nathan of the most precious
object to which his soul clings, even though danger
should thereby befall him.</p>

<p>The Templar, Leon of Filnek, represents yet
another phase of Christianity. A soldier and at the
same time a cleric, who, spared by Saladin although
he had broken his word, rescues Recha, the supposed
Jewish maiden; he behaves with Christian
insolence towards Nathan, speaking roughly and
harshly to him, whilst the latter is pouring forth
heartfelt gratitude for the rescue of his adopted
daughter. Then, gradually, through the wonderful
power of love, the Templar lays aside the coarse,
hateful garb of Christian prejudice. In his veins
there flows Mahometan blood. Only the holy simplicity
of the friar Bonafides combines human kindness
with monastic ecclesiasticism; but he knows
only one duty&mdash;obedience&mdash;and at the command of
the fanatically cruel Patriarch would commit the
most horrible crimes.</p>

<p>These lessons Lessing preached from his theatre
pulpit to the obdurate minds of the followers of
Christ. The wise Jew, Nathan&mdash;Mendelssohn&mdash;has
arrived at the highest level of human sympathy;
while the best Christian, the Templar, every cultivated
Christian&mdash;the Nicolais, the Abts, the Herders&mdash;have
yet to free themselves from their thick-skinned
prejudices, to attain to that height. It is a
delusion to claim the possession of the one true religion
and the only means of salvation. Who possesses
the real ring? How can the real one be
detected from the false? Only by meekness, heartfelt
tolerance, true benevolence, and most fervent
devotion to God; in short, by all those qualities
which the official Christianity of the time did not
display, and which were perfectly realized in Mendelssohn.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_326" id="Page_326">326</a></span>
In every way Lessing scourged fossilized, persecuting
Christianity, and glorified Judaism through
its chief representative. As if this splendid drama,
the beautiful first-fruits of German poetry, was to
belong to the Jews, although given to the world by
a Christian poet, a son of Israel aided its production.
Lessing, besieged by theological foes, and fighting
against dire necessity, would not have been able to
complete it, if, during its composition, he had not
been enabled to live without anxiety. He required
a loan, and found no helper among the Christians.
Moses Wessely, in Hamburg, the brother of the
neo-Hebraic poet, Naphtali Wessely, who afterwards
made a name for himself in Jewish history, advanced
the desired sum, although he was not a wealthy Jew,
and only wished to have the honor of possessing
something in Lessing's handwriting.</p>

<p>Lessing had not been wrong in thinking that this
drama would vex pious Christians much more than
ten controversial pamphlets against G√∂ze. As soon
as it appeared (spring, 1779), intense wrath was felt
against the poet, as if he had degraded Christianity.
The "Fragments" and his polemics against G√∂ze
had not made him so many enemies as "Nathan."
Even his friends greeted him coldly, shunned him,
excluded him from the social reunions he loved, and
left him to the persecution of his adversaries.
Through this silent excommunication he felt himself
aggrieved, lost more and more of his bright humor
and elasticity of spirit, and became wearied, downcast,
and almost stupefied. The treatment of pious
Christians terribly embittered the last year of his
life. He died in vigorous manhood like an aged
man, a martyr to his love of truth. But his soul-conquering
voice made itself heard on behalf of tolerance,
and gradually softened the discordant notes
of hatred and prejudice. In spite of the ban placed
upon "Nathan," as well as upon its author, both in
Protestant and Catholic countries, this drama became<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_327" id="Page_327">327</a></span>
one of the most popular in German poetry,
and as often as the verses inspired by conviction
resound from the stage, they seize upon the hearts
of the audience, loosening the links of the chain of
Jew-hatred in the minds of Germans, who find it
most difficult to throw off its shackles. "Nathan"
made an impression on the mind of the German
people, which, despite unfavorable circumstances,
has not been obliterated. Twenty years before,
when Lessing produced his first drama of "The
Jews," an arrogant theologian censured it, because
it was altogether too improbable that among a
people like the Jews, so noble a character could
ever be formed. At the appearance of "Nathan"
no reader thought that a noble Jew was possible.
Even the most stubborn dared not assert so monstrous
an absurdity. The Jewish ideal sage was a
reality, and lived in Berlin, an ornament not alone
to the Jews, but to the German nation. Without
Mendelssohn, the drama of "Nathan" would not
have been written, just as without Lessing's friendship
Mendelssohn would not have become what he
did to German literature and the Jewish world.
The cordiality of the intimacy between these two
friends showed itself after Lessing's death. His
brothers and friends, who only after his demise
realized his greatness, turned, in the anguish of
their loss, to Mendelssohn, as if it were natural that
he should be the chief mourner. And in very sooth
he was; none of his associates preserved Lessing's
memory with so sorrowful a remembrance and
religious a reverence. He was beyond all things
solicitous to protect his former friend against misapprehension
and slander.</p>

<p>As Mendelssohn, without knowing or desiring it,
stimulated Lessing to create an ideal, and through
him helped to dispel the bias against Jews, so at
the same time, without aiming at it, he inaugurated
the spiritual regeneration of his race. The Bible,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_328" id="Page_328">328</a></span>
especially the Pentateuch&mdash;the all in all of the
Jews&mdash;although very many knew it by heart, had
become as strange to them, as any unintelligible
book. Rabbinical and Kabbalistic expositors had
so distorted the simple biblical sense of the words,
that everything was found in it except the actual
contents.</p>

<p>Polish school-masters&mdash;there were no others&mdash;with
rod and angry gestures, instructed Jewish boys
in tender youth to discover the most absurd perversities
in the Holy Book, translating it into their
hateful jargon, and so confusing the text with their
own translation, that it seemed as if Moses had
spoken in the barbarous dialect of Polish Jews.</p>

<p>The neglect of all secular knowledge, which increased
with every century, had reached such a
pitch that every nonsensical oddity, even blasphemy,
was subtly read into the verses of Scripture. What
had been intended as a comfort to the soul was
changed into a poison. Mendelssohn acutely felt
this ignorance and wresting of Bible words, for he
had arrived at the enlightened view that Holy Writ
does not contain "that which Jews and Christians
believe they can find therein," and that a good, simple
translation would be an important step towards
the promotion of culture among Jews. But in his
modesty and diffidence it did not occur to him to
employ these means to educate his brethren. He
compiled a translation of the Pentateuch for his
children, to give them a thorough education and to
introduce the word of God to them in an undisfigured
form, without troubling (as he observed)
"whether they would continue to be compelled, in
Saxe-Gotha, on every journey, to pay for their Jewish
heads at a game of dice, or to tell the story of
the three rings to every petty ruler." It was only
at the urgent request of a man whose word carried
weight with Mendelssohn, that he decided to publish
his translation of the Pentateuch into German<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_329" id="Page_329">329</a></span>
(in Jewish-German characters) for Jewish readers.
It cost him an effort, however, to attach his name
to it.</p>

<p>He knew his Jewish public too well not to understand
that the translation, however excellently it
might be done, would meet with little approval, unless
it were accompanied by a Hebrew exposition.
Of what value to the depraved taste of Jewish
readers was a book without a commentary? From
time immemorial, since commentaries and super-commentaries
had come into existence, these had
been much more admired than the most beautiful
text. Mendelssohn, therefore, obtained the assistance
of an educated Pole, named Solomon Dubno,
who, a praiseworthy exception to his countrymen,
was thoroughly acquainted with Hebrew grammar,
to undertake the composition of a running commentary.
The work was begun by securing the
necessary subscribers, without whom no book could
at that time be issued. It became apparent that
Mendelssohn had already many supporters and admirers
among his brethren, within and beyond Germany.
His undertaking, which was to remove from
the Jews the reproach of ignorance of their own literature,
and of speaking a corrupt language, was
hailed with joy. Most of the subscribers came from
Berlin and Mendelssohn's native town, Dessau,
which was indeed proud of him. From Poland also
orders for the Germanized "Torah" arrived, mostly
from Wilna, where Elijah Wilna, to a certain extent
a liberal thinker, and the visionary perversities of
the New-Chassidim had drawn attention to the
Holy Scriptures. As a sign of the times, it may
also be noticed that the translation was purchased
by Christians, professors, pastors, court preachers,
consistorial councilors, court councilors, and the
nobility. Mendelssohn's Christian friends were,
indeed, extraordinarily active in promoting his work.
Eliza Reimarus, Lessing's noble friend, even collected
subscriptions.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_330" id="Page_330">330</a></span>
Glad as were Mendelssohn's admirers to receive
the news of a Pentateuch translation from his hand,
so disturbed were the rigid adherents to antiquity
and obsolete habit. They felt vividly, without being
able to think it out clearly, that the old times, with
their ingenuous credulity&mdash;which regarded everything
with unquestioned faith as an emanation from
a Divine source&mdash;would now sink into the grave.</p>

<p>No sooner was a specimen of the translation
published, than the rabbis of the old school were
prejudiced against it, and planned how to keep the
enemy from the house of Jacob. To these opponents
of Mendelssohn's enterprise belonged men
who brought honor upon Judaism, not alone by
their Rabbinical scholarship and keen intellects, but
also by their nobility of character. There were especially
three men, Poles by birth, who had as little
appreciation of the innovations of the times as of
beauty of form and purity of speech. One of them,
Ezekiel Landau (chief rabbi of Prague, from the
year 1752; died in 1793), enjoyed great respect
both within and outside his community. He was a
clever man, and learned in time to swim with the
tide. The second, Raphael Cohen, the grandfather
of Riesser (born 1722, died 1803), who had emigrated
from Poland, and had been called from Posen
to the rabbinate of the three communities of Hamburg,
Altona, and Wandsbeck, was a firm, decided
character, without guile or duplicity, who as judge
meted out justice without respect to persons, considering
justice the support of God's throne. The
third and youngest was Hirsch Janow, a son-in-law
of Raphael Cohen, who, on account of his profound
acumen in Talmudical discussions, was called the
"keen scholar" (born 1750, died 1785). His acute
mind was equally versed in the intricate problems
of mathematics as in those of the Talmud. He was
thoroughly unselfish, the trifling income that he received
from the impoverished community of Posen<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_331" id="Page_331">331</a></span>
he gave away to the unfortunate; he distributed
alms with open-handed benevolence, and without
asking questions whether the recipients were orthodox
or heretics, whilst he himself starved. He contracted
debts to save the needy from misery.
Solomon Maimon, a deep thinker, who had opportunities
of knowing men from their worst side,
called this rabbi of Posen and F√ºrth "a godly man,"
an epithet not to be considered an exaggeration
from such lips. To these three rabbis a fourth kindred
spirit may be added, Phineas Levi Hurwitz
(born 1740; died 1802), rabbi of Frankfort-on-the-Main,
also a Pole, educated in the Chassidean
school. These men, and others who thought like
them, and who regarded the perusal of a German
book as a grievous sin, from their point of view
were right in opposing Mendelssohn's innovation.
They perceived that the Jewish youth would learn
the German language from the Mendelssohn translation
more than an understanding of the "Torah";
that the former would strongly tend to become the
chief object of study; the attention to Holy Writ
would degenerate into an unimportant secondary
matter, whilst the study of the Talmud would be
completely suppressed. Though Mendelssohn himself
enjoyed good repute from a religious point of
view, his adherents and supporters were not invariably
free from reproach. Unworthy men, who had
broken with Judaism, and conceitedly termed themselves
Mendelssohnians, were energetic in advancing
the sale of the translation, and thus brought it
into suspicion with the rigidly orthodox party.</p>

<p>Raphael Cohen, of Hamburg, a man of hasty
temper, was the most zealous agitator against the
German version of the Bible. But as Mendelssohn
had relatives on his wife's side in this town, and
also many admirers, no action could be taken
against him there or in Prague, where there were
freethinkers among the Jews. F√ºrth, therefore,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_332" id="Page_332">332</a></span>
was looked upon as the fittest place whence the interdict
(about June, 1779) against "the German
Pentateuch of Moses of Dessau" should be
launched. All true to Judaism were forbidden, under
penalty of excommunication, to use this translation.</p>

<p>Meanwhile the conflict between the old and the
new Judaism was conducted with calmness, and no
violent symptoms showed themselves. If Jacob
Emden had been alive, the contest would have raged
more fiercely, and evoked more disturbance. Mendelssohn
was too unselfish, too gentle and philosophically
tranquil to grow excited on hearing of the
ban against his undertaking, or to solicit the aid of
his Christian friends of high rank in silencing his
opponents. He was prepared for opposition.
"As soon as I yielded to Dubno to have my translation
printed, I placed my soul in my hands, raised
my eyes to the mountains, and gave my back to the
smiters." He regarded the play of human passions
and excessive ardor for religion as natural phenomena,
which demanded quiet observation. He did
not wish to disturb this peaceful observation by external
influence, by threats and prohibitions, or by
the interference of the temporal power. "Perhaps
a little excitement serves the best interests of the
enterprise nearest to my heart." He suggested
that if his version had been received without opposition,
its superfluity would have been proved.
"The more the so-called wise men of the day object
to it, the more necessary it is. At first, I only
intended it for ordinary people, but now I find that
it is much more needful for rabbis." On the part of
his opponents, however, no decided efforts were
made to suppress his translation, which appeared
to them so dangerous, or to denounce its author.
Only in certain Polish towns, such as Posen and
Lissa, it was forbidden, and it is said to have been
publicly committed to the flames. Violent action<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_333" id="Page_333">333</a></span>
was to be feared only from the indiscreet, resolute
Rabbi Raphael Cohen. He seems, however, to
have delayed action until the whole appeared, in
order to obtain proofs of deserved condemnation.
Mendelssohn, therefore, sought help to counteract
his zeal. He prevailed upon his friend, Augustus
von Hennigs, Danish state councilor and brother-in-law
of his intimate friend, Eliza Reimarus, to try
to induce the king of Denmark and certain courtiers
to become subscribers to the work; this would
quench the ardor of the zealot. Hennigs, a man of
hasty action, forthwith turned to the Danish minister,
Von Guldberg, to fulfill the request of Mendelssohn.
To his astonishment and Mendelssohn's, he
received an insulting reply, to the effect that the
king and his illustrious brothers were prepared to
subscribe if the minister could assure them that the
translation contained nothing against the inspiration
and truth of the Holy Scriptures, so that the
Jews might not afterwards say "that Moses Mendelssohn
was an adherent to the (ill-famed) religion
of Berlin."</p>

<p>This "Berlin religion" was at the time the terror
of the orthodox, both in the Church and the Synagogue,
and it cannot be said to have been an idle
fear. To keep at a distance this scoffing tendency
against religion, over-zealous rabbis tried to block
every possible avenue of approach to the houses of
the Jews. Events of the immediate future proved
that the rabbis were not pursuing a phantom.
Mendelssohn, in his innocent piety, did not recognize
the enemy, although it passed to and fro
through his own house. At length, the interdict
against Mendelssohn's translation of the Pentateuch
was promulgated by Raphael Cohen (July 17th); it
was directed against all Jews who read the new
version. The author himself was not excommunicated,
either out of consideration for his prominence,
or from weakness and half-heartedness. However,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_334" id="Page_334">334</a></span>
before the blow fell, Mendelssohn had warded off
its consequences. He persuaded Von Hennigs that
he need have no scruples about obtaining the king's
subscription for the translation, and it was done.
At the head of the list of contributors stood the
names of King Christian of Denmark and the Crown
Prince. By this means Raphael Cohen was
effectually foiled in his endeavors to condemn and
destroy a work which he regarded as heretical.</p>

<p>His adversaries nevertheless struck Mendelssohn
a blow, to hinder the completion of the translation.
They succeeded in alienating Solomon Dubno, his
right-hand man, which caused Mendelssohn serious
perplexity. That his work might not remain unfinished,
he had to undertake the commentary to the
Pentateuch himself, but finding the work beyond his
strength he was obliged to seek for assistants. In
Wessely he found a co-operator of similar disposition
to his own; but he did not care to undertake
the whole burden, and thus Mendelssohn was compelled
to entrust a portion to Herz Homberg, his
son's tutor, and to another Pole, Aaron Jaroslav.
The former was not altogether a congenial associate.
He knew that Homberg in his heart was
estranged from Judaism, and that he would not
execute the holy work according to his method and
as a sacred duty, as he himself felt it to be. But he
had no alternative. Owing to Homberg's participation
in the work, the translation, finished in 1783,
was discredited by the orthodox; and they desired
to exclude it altogether from Jewish houses.</p>

<p>This severity roused opposition. Forbidden fruit
tastes sweet. Youthful students of the Talmud
seized upon the German translation behind the
backs of their masters, who depreciated the new influence,
and in secret learned at once the most
elementary and the most sublime lessons&mdash;the German
language and the philosophy of religion,
Hebrew grammar and poetry. A new view of the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_335" id="Page_335">335</a></span>
world was opened to them. The Hebrew commentary
served as a guide to a proper understanding
of the translation. As if touched by a magic
wand, the Talmud students, fossils of the musty
schoolhouses, were transfigured, and upon the wings
of the intellect they soared above the gloomy present,
and took their flight heavenwards. An insatiable
desire for knowledge took possession of them; no
territory, however dark, remained inaccessible to
them. The acumen, quick comprehension, and profound
penetrativeness, which these youths had acquired
in their close study of the Talmud, rendered
it easy for them to take their position in the newly-discovered
world. Thousands of Talmud students
from the great schools of Hamburg, Prague, Nikolsburg,
Frankfort-on-the-Main, F√ºrth, and even from
Poland, became little Mendelssohns; many of them
eloquent, profound thinkers. With them Judaism
renewed its youth. All who, towards the end of the
eighteenth and the beginning of the nineteenth century,
were in various ways public workers, had up
to a certain period in their lives been one-sided
Talmudists, and needed the inspiration of Mendelssohn's
example to become exponents and promoters
of culture among Jews. In a very short time a
numerous band of Jewish authors arose, who wrote
in a clear Hebrew or German style upon matters
of which shortly before they had had no knowledge.
The Mendelssohn translation speedily resulted in a
veritable renaissance of the Jews. They found their
level in European civilization more quickly than the
Germans, and&mdash;what should not be overlooked&mdash;Talmudic
schooling had sharpened their intelligence.
Mendelssohn's translation of the Pentateuch, together
with his paraphrase of the Psalms, has produced
more good than that of Luther, because instead
of fossilizing, it animated the mind. The inner
freedom of the Jews, as has been said, dates from
this translation.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_336" id="Page_336">336</a></span>
The beginning of the outward liberation of the
Jews from the cruel bondage of thousands of years
was also connected with Mendelssohn's name, and
like his activity for their internal freedom was unconscious,
without violence or calculation. It seems
a miracle, though no marvelous occurrence accompanied
it. It secured to the Jews two advocates,
than whom none more zealous, none warmer could
be desired: these were Lessing and Dohm.</p>

<p>Since the middle of the eighteenth century the
attention of the cultured world had been directed
towards the Jews without any action on their part.
Montesquieu, the first to penetrate to the profound
depths of human laws and reveal their spirit, was
also the first to raise his weighty voice against the
barbarous treatment of the Jews. In his widely-read,
suggestive work, "Spirit of the Laws," he had demonstrated,
with convincing arguments, the harm that
the ill-treatment of the Jews had caused to states,
and branded the cruelty of the Inquisition with an
ineradicable stigma. The piercing cry of agony of
a tortured Marrano at sight of a stake prepared for
a "Judaizing" maiden of eighteen years of age in
Lisbon had aroused Montesquieu, and the echo of
his voice resounded throughout Europe.</p>

<blockquote>

<p>"You Christians complain that the Emperor of China roasts all
Christians in his dominions over a slow fire. You behave much
worse towards Jews, because they do not believe as you do. If any
of our descendants should ever venture to say that the nations of
Europe were cultured, your example will be adduced to prove that
they were barbarians. The picture that they will draw of you will
certainly stain your age, and spread abroad hatred of all your contemporaries."</p></blockquote>

<p>Montesquieu had rediscovered the true idea of
justice, which mankind had lost. But how difficult
was it to cause this idea to be fully recognized with
reference to Jews!</p>

<p>Two events had brought the Jews, their concerns,
their present, and their past before public notice:
their demand for a legal standing in England, and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_337" id="Page_337">337</a></span>
Voltaire's attacks upon them. In England, where
a century before they had, as it were, crept in, they
formed a separate community, especially in the capital,
without being tolerated or recognized by law.
They were regarded as foreigners&mdash;as Spaniards,
Portuguese, Dutchmen, or Germans, and had to pay
the alien duty. However, the authorities, especially
the judges, showed regard for the Jewish belief; for
instance, they did not summon Jewish witnesses
on the Sabbath. After the Jews settled in the
American colonies of England had been naturalized,
a bill was presented in Parliament by merchants
and manufacturers, Jews and their friends, to be
sure, begging that they be treated as natives of
England, without being compelled to obtain civil
rights by taking the sacrament, as the law prescribed.
Pelham, the minister, supported the petition,
and pointed out the advantages that would accrue
to the country by the large capital of the Portuguese
Jews and their warm attachment to England.
By their opponents, however, partly self-interest,
partly religious prejudices were brought to bear
against them. It was urged that, placed on an equal
footing with English citizens, the Jews would acquire
the whole wealth of the kingdom, would obtain possession
of all the landed property, and disinherit
Christians: the latter would be their slaves, and the
Jews would choose their own rulers and kings.
Orthodox literalists argued that according to Christian
prophecies they were to remain without a home
until gathered to the land of their fathers. Surprisingly
enough, a bill was passed by the Upper
House permitting Jews who had resided in England
or Ireland for three consecutive years to be naturalized;
but they were not to occupy any secular or
clerical office, nor to receive the Parliamentary franchise.
The lords and the bishops, then, were not
opposed to the Jews. The majority of the Lower
House also agreed to the bill, and George II ratified<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_338" id="Page_338">338</a></span>
it (March, 1753). Was the decision of the Three
Estates really the expression of the majority of the
nation? This at once became doubtful: imprecations
were immediately thundered from pulpits,
guilds, and the taverns against the ministry which
had urged the Naturalization Act for Jews. In our
days it seems hardly credible that the London merchants
should have feared the ruin of their trade by
the influx of Jewish capitalists. Deacon Josiah
Tucker, who took the part of the Jews, and defended
the Naturalization Act, was attacked by the opposition
in parliament, in the newspapers, and in
pamphlets, and his effigy, together with his defense
of the Jews, was burnt at Bristol. To the vexation
of the liberal-minded, the ministry were weak
enough to yield to the clamor of the populace arising
from mercantile jealousy and fanatical intolerance,
and to annul their own work (1754) "because it had
provoked displeasure, and the minds of many loyal
subjects had been disquieted thereby." For, even
the most violent enemies of the act could not impute
evil to the Jews of England; they created a good
impression upon Englishmen by their riches, accumulated
without usury, and by their noble bearing.
Public opinion warmly sided with them and their
claims for civil equality, and if, for the moment,
these were disregarded, yet no unfavorable result
ensued.</p>

<p>The second occurrence, although originating in a
single person, roused even more attention than the
action of the English Parliament towards the Jews.
This person was Arouet de Voltaire, king in the
domain of literature in the eighteenth century, who
with his demoniacal laughter blew down like a house
of cards the stronghold of the Middle Ages. He,
who believed neither in Providence nor in the moral
progress of mankind, was a mighty instrument of
history in the advancement of progress. Voltaire&mdash;in
his writings an entrancing wizard, a sage, in his<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_339" id="Page_339">339</a></span>
life a fool, the slave of base passions&mdash;picked a
quarrel with the Jews, and sneered at them and their
past. His hostility arose from personal ill-humor
and irritability. He maintained that during his stay
in London he lost eighty per cent of a loan of
25,000 francs, through the bankruptcy of a Jewish
capitalist named Medina. He cannot, however,
always be believed.</p>

<blockquote>

<p>"Medina told me that he was not to blame for his bankruptcy:
that he was unfortunate, that he had never been a son of Belial.
He moved me, I embraced him, we praised God together, and I lost
my money. I have never hated the Jewish nation; I hate nobody."</p></blockquote>

<p>Yet, a low-minded Harpagon, who clung to his
money, Voltaire, on account of this large or small
loss, hated not only this Jew, but all Jews on earth.
A second incident excited him still more against
them. When Voltaire was in Berlin and Potsdam
as court poet, literary mentor, and attendant of
King Frederick, who both admired and detested
this diabolical genius, he gave a filthy commission
to a Jewish jeweler, named Hirsch, or Hirschel
(1750), which he afterwards, at the instigation of a
rival in the trade, named Ephraim Veitel, wished to
withdraw. Friction arose between Voltaire and
Hirschel, until some arrangement was made, which
the former afterwards desired to evade. In a word,
Voltaire practiced a series of mean tricks upon his
Jewish tradesman: cheated him about some diamonds,
abused him, lied, forged documents, and
acted as if he were the injured party. At length a
complicated lawsuit sprang from these proceedings.
King Frederick, who had obtained information of
all this from the legal documents, and from a pamphlet,
written ostensibly by Hirsch, in reality by
Voltaire's enemies, was highly enraged with the
poet and philosopher scamp. He resolved to banish
him from Prussia, and wrote against him a comedy
in French verse, called "Tantalus in the Lawsuit."
Voltaire's quarrel with the Prussian Jew<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_340" id="Page_340">340</a></span>
created a sensation, and provided ample material
for the mischievous delight of his opponents.</p>

<p>Next to avarice, revenge was a prominent feature
in his character. It was too trifling for Voltaire
to avenge himself upon the individual Jew who had
contributed to his humiliation; he determined to
make the whole Jewish nation feel his hatred.
Whenever he had an opportunity of speaking of
Judaism or Jews, he bespattered the Jews of the
past and the present with his obscene satire. This
accorded with his method of warfare. Christianity,
which he thoroughly hated and despised, could not
be attacked openly without rendering the aggressor
liable to severe punishment. Judaism, the parent
of Christianity, therefore served as the target,
against which he hurled his elegant, lightly brandished,
but venomous darts. In one of his essays
particularly he poured forth his gall against Jews
and Judaism.</p>

<p>This partial and superficial estimate of the Jews,
this summary judgment of a whole people, and a
history of a thousand years, irritated many truth-loving
men; but no one dared provoke a quarrel
with so dreaded an antagonist as Voltaire. It required
a bold spirit, but it was hazarded by a cultured
Jew, named Isaac Pinto, more from skillfully-calculated
motives than from indignation at Voltaire's
baseless defamation. Pinto (born in Bordeaux,
1715; died in Amsterdam, 1787) belonged to a
Portuguese Marrano family, was rich, cultivated,
noble, and disinterested in his own affairs; but suffered
from pardonable egoism, namely, on behalf
of the community. After leaving Bordeaux he settled
in Amsterdam, where he not only served the
Portuguese community, but also advanced large
sums of money to the government of Holland, and
therefore held an honorable position. He always
took warm interest in the congregation in which
he had been born, and assisted it by word and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_341" id="Page_341">341</a></span>
deed. But his heart was most devoted to the Portuguese
Jews, his brethren by race and speech; on
the other hand, he was indifferent and cold towards
the Jews of the German and Polish tongues; he
looked down upon them with disdainful pride, as
Christians of rank upon lowly Jews. Nobility of
mind and pride of race were intimately combined in
Pinto. In certain unpleasant matters in which the
Portuguese community of Bordeaux had become
entangled, he displayed, on the one hand, ardent
zeal, on the other, hardness of heart. In this prosperous
commercial town, since the middle of the
sixteenth century, there had flourished a congregation
of fugitive Marranos, who had fled from the
prisons and the autos-da-f√© of the Spanish and Portuguese
Inquisition. These refugees had brought
considerable capital and an enterprising spirit, and
thus secured right of residence and certain privileges,
but only under the name of new-Christians or
Portuguese merchants. For a time they were
forced to undergo the hypocrisy of having their
marriages solemnized in the churches. Their numbers
gradually increased; in two centuries (1550&ndash;1750)
the congregation of Bordeaux had grown to
200 families, or 500 souls. The majority of the
Portuguese Jews, or new-Christians, of Bordeaux,
kept large banking-houses, engaged in the manufacture
of arms, equipped ships, or undertook trans-marine
business with French colonies. To their
importance as merchants and ship-owners they
united staunch uprightness, blameless honesty in
business, liberality towards Jews and non-Jews, and
the dignity which they had brought from the Pyrenean
peninsula, their unnatural mother-country.
Thus they gained respect and distinction among
the Christian inhabitants of Bordeaux, and the
French court as well as the high officials connived
at their presence, and gradually came to recognize
them as Jews. The important mercantile town also<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_342" id="Page_342">342</a></span>
attracted German Jews from Alsace, and French
Jews from Avignon, under papal government, who
obtained the right to settle by paying large sums
of money. The Portuguese Jews were jealous;
they feared that they would be placed on a level
with these co-religionists, who were little educated,
and engaged in petty trading or monetary transactions,
and that they would lose their honorable
reputation. Induced by these selfish motives they
exerted themselves to have the immigrant German
and Avignon Jews expelled from the town, by appealing
to the old edict that Jews might not dwell
in France. But the exiles contrived to gain the
protection of influential persons at court, and thus
obtained the privilege of sojourn. Through the
connivance of the authorities, 152 foreign Jews had
already flocked to Bordeaux, several of whom had
powerful friends. This was a thorn in the side of
the Portuguese, and to hinder the influx of strangers,
they passed (1760) an illiberal communal law
against their foreign co-religionists. They branded
every foreign Jew not of Portuguese origin as a
vagrant and a beggar, and as a burden to the
wealthy. They calumniated the strangers, asserting
that they followed dishonorable, fraudulent occupations,
and thereby predisposed the citizens and
authorities against them. According to their proposal,
Portuguese Jews, or their council, should be
vested with the right to expel the foreign Jews, or
"vagrants," from the town within three days. This
cruel and heartless statute had to be confirmed by
King Louis XV. It was not difficult to obtain from
this monarch, who was ruled by his wives and his
courtiers, the most inhuman petitions. A friend
and kinsman of Isaac Pinto undertook to get the
sanction of the court for this statute.</p>

<p>This was Jacob Rodrigues Pereira (born in Spain,
1715; died in Paris, 1780), grandfather of the famous
and enterprising Emile and Isaac Pereira, a<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_343" id="Page_343">343</a></span>
man of talent and noble character, and an artist of a
peculiar kind, who had obtained wide renown. He
had invented a sign language for the deaf and
dumb, and taught these unfortunate people a means
of expressing their thoughts. As a Marrano, he
had taught the deaf and dumb in Spain. Love for
the religion of his ancestors, or hatred of the bloodthirsty
Catholic Church impelled him to leave the
land of the Inquisition (about 1734), and, together
with his mother and sister, to emigrate to Bordeaux.
Here, even before Abb√© de l'Ep√©e, he so
thoroughly verified his theory for the instruction of
those born dumb, in a specially appointed school,
that the king conferred a reward, and the first men
of science&mdash;D'Alembert, Buffon, Diderot, and Rousseau&mdash;lavished
praises upon him. Pereira afterwards
became royal interpreter and member of the
Royal Society in London. The Portuguese community
of Bordeaux appointed him their representative
in Paris, to ventilate their complaints and
accomplish their ends. Moved with sympathy for
the unfortunate, he was yet so filled with communal
egoism, that he did not hesitate to inflict injury
upon his German and Avignon co-religionists.
The commission to secure from Louis XV the ratification
of the proposed statute, he carried out but
too conscientiously. But in the disorderly government
of this king and his court there was a vast
difference between the passing and the administering
of a law. The higher officials were able to circumvent
any law or defer its execution. The expulsion
of the Jews of German and Avignon origin
from Bordeaux lay in the hands of the governor,
the Duc de Richelieu. Isaac Pinto, who was on intimate
terms with him, was able to win his support.
Richelieu issued an urgent command (November,
1761) that within two weeks all foreign Jews should
be banished from Bordeaux. Exception was made
only in favor of two old men and women whom the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_344" id="Page_344">344</a></span>
hardships of the expulsion would have killed, and
of a man who had been of service to the town
(Jacob de Perpignan). All the rest were plunged
into unavoidable distress, as it was forbidden to
Jews to settle anywhere in France, and the districts
and towns where Jews already dwelt admitted no
new-comers. What a difference between the German
Jew Moses Mendelssohn and the Portuguese
Jews Isaac Pinto and Rodrigues Pereira, who in
their time were ranked side by side! The former
did not cease his efforts, until by his influence he
brought help to his unhappy brethren, or at least
offered them comfort. For the Jews in Switzerland,
who were tolerated only in two small towns, and
even there were so enslaved that they must have
died out, Mendelssohn procured some alleviation
through his opponent Lavater. Several hundred
Jews were about to be expelled from Dresden, because
they could not pay the poll-tax laid upon
them. Through Mendelssohn's intercession with
one of his numerous admirers, Cabinet Councilor
Von Ferber, the unfortunate people obtained permission
to remain in Dresden. To a Jewish Talmudical
scholar unjustly suspected of theft and
imprisoned in Leipsic, Mendelssohn cleverly contrived
to send a letter of consolation, whereby
he gained his freedom. Isaac Pinto and Jacob
Pereira, on the other hand, were zealous in
bringing about the expulsion of their brethren by
race and religion, which Mendelssohn considered
the hardest punishment of the Jews, "equal to annihilation
from the face of God's earth, where
armed prejudice repulses them at every frontier."</p>

<p>The cruel proceedings of the Portuguese Jews
against their brethren in Bordeaux made a great
stir. If Jews might not tarry in France, why should
those of Portuguese tongue be tolerated? The
latter, therefore, saw themselves compelled to put
themselves in a favorable light, and requested Isaac<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_345" id="Page_345">345</a></span>
Pinto, who had already appeared in public, and
possessed literary culture, to write a sort of vindication
for them, and make clear the wide difference
between Jews of Portuguese descent and those of
other lands. Pinto consented, or rather followed
his own inclination, and prepared the "Reflections"
upon Voltaire's defamation of Judaism (1762). He
told this reckless calumniator that the crime of
libeling single individuals was increased when the
false accusations affected a whole nation, and
reached its highest degree when directed against a
people insulted by all men, and when the responsibility
for the misdeeds of a few is laid upon the
whole body, whose members, moreover, widely
scattered, have assumed the character of the
inhabitants of the country in which they live.
An English Jew as little resembles his co-religionist
of Constantinople, as the latter does a Chinese
mandarin; the Jew of Bordeaux and he of
Metz are two utterly different beings. Nevertheless,
Voltaire had indiscriminately condemned them,
and his sketch of them was as absurd as untrue.
Voltaire, who felt called upon to extirpate prejudices,
had in fact lent his pen to the greatest of
them. He does not indeed wish them to be burnt,
but a number of Jews would rather be burnt than
so calumniated. "The Jews are not more ignorant,
more barbarous, or superstitious than other nations,
least of all do they merit the accusation of avarice."
Voltaire owed a duty to the Jews, to truth, to his
century, and to posterity, which would justly appeal
to his authority when abusing and trying to crush
an exceedingly unhappy people.</p>

<p>However, as already said, it was not so much
Pinto's aim to vindicate the whole of the Jewish
world against Voltaire's malicious charges as to
place his kinsmen, the Portuguese or Sephardic
Jews, in a more favorable light. To this end, he
pretended that a wide gulf existed between them<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_346" id="Page_346">346</a></span>
and those of other extraction, especially the German
and Polish Jews. He averred, with great exaggeration,
that if a Sephardic Jew in England or Holland
wedded a German Jewess, he would be excluded
from the community by his relatives, and would not
even find a resting-place in their cemetery. This
arose from the fact that the Portuguese Jews traced
their lineage from the noblest families of the tribe
of Judah, and that their noble descent had always
in Spain and Portugal been an impulse to great virtues
and a protection against vice and crime.
Among them no traces of the wickedness or evil
deeds of which Voltaire accused them were to be
found. On the contrary, they had brought wealth
to the states which received them, especially to Holland.
The German and Polish Jews, on the other
hand, Pinto abandoned to the attacks of their detractors,
except that he excused their not over
honorable trades and despicable actions by the
overwhelming sufferings, the slavery, and humiliation
which they had endured, and were still enduring.
He succeeded in obtaining what he had desired. In
reply, Voltaire paid him and the Portuguese Jews
compliments, and admitted that he had done wrong
in including them in his charges, but nevertheless
continued to abuse Jewish antiquity.</p>

<p>Pinto's defense attracted great attention. The
press, both French and English, pronounced a
favorable judgment, and espoused the cause of the
Jews against Voltaire. But they blamed Pinto for
having been too partial to the Portuguese, and too
strongly opposed to the German and Polish Jews,
and, like Voltaire, passing sentence upon all indiscriminately,
because of the behavior of a few individuals.
A Catholic priest under a Jewish disguise
took up the cause of Hebrew antiquity. He addressed
"Jewish Letters" to Voltaire, pretending
that they came from Portuguese and German Jews;
these were well meant but badly composed. They<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_347" id="Page_347">347</a></span>
were widely read, and helped to turn the current
of public opinion in favor of the Jews against
Voltaire's savage attacks. They did not fail to remind
him that owing to loss of money sustained
through one Jew he pursued the whole race with his
anger. This friendly pamphlet on behalf of the
Jews being written in French, then the fashionable
language, it was extensively read and discussed, and
found a favorable reception.</p>

<p>Sympathy for the Jews and the movement to elevate
them from their servile position were most
materially stimulated by a persecution which humane
thinkers of the time considered surprising and unexpected,
but which has often been repeated in the
midst of Christian nations. This persecution kindled
passions on both sides, and awakened men to
activity. In no part of Europe, perhaps, were the
oppression and abasement of Jews greater than in
the originally German, but at that time French province
of Alsace, to which Metz may be reckoned.
All causes of inveterate Jew-hatred&mdash;clerical intolerance,
racial antipathy, arbitrariness of the nobility,
mercantile jealousy, and brute ignorance&mdash;were
combined against the Jews of Alsace, to render their
existence in the century of enlightenment a continual
hell. Yet the oppression was so paltry in its
nature that it could never stimulate the Jews to offer
heroic resistance. The German populace of this
province, like Germans in general, clung tenaciously
to their hatred of the Jews. Both the nobles and
citizens of Alsace turned a deaf ear to the voice of
humanity, which spoke so eloquently in French literature,
and would not abate one jot of their legal
rights over the Jews, who were treated as serfs. In
Alsace there lived from three to four thousand Jewish
families (from fifteen to twenty thousand souls).
It was in the power of the nobility to admit new, or
expel old families. In Metz the merchants had had
a law passed limiting Jews to four hundred and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_348" id="Page_348">348</a></span>
eighty families. This condition of affairs had the
same consequences as in Austria and Prussia:
younger sons were condemned to celibacy, or exile
from their paternal home, and daughters to remain
unmarried. In fact, it was worse than in Austria
and elsewhere, because German pedantry carefully
looked to the execution of these rigorous Pharaonic
laws, and stealthily watched the French officials, lest
any attempt be made to show indulgence towards
the unfortunate people. Naturally the Jews of Alsace
and Metz were enclosed in Ghettos, and could
only occasionally pass through the other parts of the
towns. For these privileges they were compelled
to pay exorbitant taxes.</p>

<p>Louis XIV had presented a portion of his income
derived from the Jews of Metz as a gift to the Duc
de Brancas and the Countess de Fontaine. They
had to pay these persons 20,000 livres annually;
besides poll-taxes, trade-taxes, house-taxes, contributions
to churches and hospitals, war-taxes, and
exactions of every sort under other names.</p>

<p>In Alsace they were obliged to pay protection-money
to the king, tribute to the bishop of Strasburg,
and the duke of Hagenau, besides residence-taxes
to the nobles in whose feudal territory they
dwelt, and war-taxes. The privilege of residence
did not descend to the eldest son, but had to be purchased
from the nobleman, as if the son were a foreign
applicant for protection. The Jews had to win
the good opinion, not alone of their lord, but also of
his officials, by rich gifts at New Year, and on other
occasions. Whence could they procure all these
moneys, and still support their synagogues and
schools?</p>

<p>Almost every handicraft and trade were forbidden
them in Alsace: legally they could engage
only in cattle-dealing, and in trading in gold and
silver. In Metz the Jews were allowed to kill only
such animals as they required for private consumption,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_349" id="Page_349">349</a></span>
and the appointed slaughterers had to keep a
list of the animals slain. If they wished to make a
journey outside their narrow province, they had to
pay a poll-tax, and were subjected to the vexations
of passports. In Strasburg, the capital of the province,
no Jew could stay over night. What remained
but to obtain the money indispensable for
their wretched existence in an illegal way&mdash;through
usury? Those who possessed money made advances
to the small tradesmen, farmers, and vinedressers,
at the risk of losing the amounts lent, and
demanded high interest, or employed other artifices.
This only caused them to be more hated, and the
growing impoverishment of the people was attributed
to them, and was the source of their unspeakable
sufferings. They were in the sad position of
being compelled to make themselves and others
unhappy.</p>

<p>This miserable condition of the Alsatian Jews a
villainous man sought to turn to his own advantage,
and he almost brought on a sanguinary persecution.
A lawyer, not without brains and literary culture,
named Hell, belonging to a poor family, and ardently
wishing for a high position, being acquainted
with the devices of the Jewish usurers, actually
learned the Hebrew language, to be able to levy
blackmail on them without fear of discovery. He
sent threatening letters in Hebrew, saying that
they would inevitably be accused of usury and deception,
if they did not supply him with a stated
sum of money. This worthless lawyer afterwards
became district judge to several Alsatian noblemen,
and thus the Jews were given wholly into his power.
Those who did not satisfy his continually increasing
demands, were accused, ill-treated, and condemned.
Meantime his unjust conduct was partially exposed:
he was suspected, and this excited him against the
Jews of Alsace. He devised a plan to arouse fanaticism
against them. He pointed out to debtors a<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_350" id="Page_350">350</a></span>
way to escape the oppressive debts which they
owed Jewish money-lenders, by producing false receipts
as for payments already rendered. Some of
his creatures traveled through Alsace, and wrote
out such acquittances. Conscientious debtors had
their scruples silenced by the clergy, who assured
them that robbing the Jews was a righteous act.
The timid were pacified by a rogue especially despatched
for that purpose, who distributed orders
and crosses, presumably in the name of the king, to
those who accepted and presented the false receipts,
and were ready to accuse the Jews of oppression
and duplicity. Thus a menacing feeling, bordering
on actual violence, developed against the Jews of
Alsace. The debtors united with common ruffians
and clergymen to implore the weak-minded king
Louis XVI, to put an end to all disturbances by
expelling the Jews from the province. To crown
his work, the villainous district magistrate strove
to exasperate the populace against them. He
composed a venomous work against them (1779),
"Observations of an Alsatian upon the Present
Quarrels of the Jews of Alsace," in which he collected
all the slanderous accusations against Jews
from ancient times, in order to present a repulsive
picture of them, and expose them to hatred and extermination.
He admitted that receipts had been
forged, but this was in consequence of the decrees
of Providence, to whom alone vengeance was becoming.
They hoped by these means to avenge
the crucifixion of Jesus, the murder of God. This
district judge aimed at the annihilation, or, at least,
the expulsion of the Jews. But the spirit of toleration
had acquired sufficient strength to prevent the
success of such cunning designs. His base tricks
were revealed, and, at the command of the king,
Hell was imprisoned, and afterwards banished from
Alsace. A decree of the sovereign ordered (May,
1780) that lawsuits against usurers should no longer<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_351" id="Page_351">351</a></span>
be decided by the district courts of the nobility, but
by the chief councilor, or state councilor (Conseil
Souverain) of Alsace.</p>

<p>One result of these occurrences was that the
Alsatian Jews finally roused themselves, and ventured
to state that their position was intolerable,
and to entreat relief from the throne of the gentle
king Louis XVI. Their representatives (Cerf
Berr?) drew up a memorial to the state council
upon the inhuman laws under which they groaned,
and made proposals for the amelioration of their
lot. They felt, however, that this memorial should
be written so as to influence public opinion, at this
time almost as powerful as the king himself. But
in their midst there was no man of spirit and ability
who could compose a fitting description of their
condition.</p>

<p>To whom could they turn except to Mendelssohn,
looked upon by European Jews as their advocate
and powerful supporter in distress? To him, therefore,
the Alsatian Jews&mdash;or, more correctly, their
distinguished representative Cerf Berr, who knew
Mendelssohn&mdash;sent the material with the request,
to give the necessary polish and an impressive
form to their petition. Mendelssohn had neither
the leisure, nor perhaps the skill to carry out their
request. Fortunately, he had found a new friend
and admirer, who, by knowledge and position, was
better able to formulate such a memorial. Christian
William Dohm (b. 1751, d. 1820), owing to his
thorough knowledge of history, had shortly before
been appointed by Frederick the Great&mdash;with the
title of military councilor&mdash;to superintend the
archives. Like all ambitious youths and men who
frequented Berlin, Dohm had sought out the Jewish
philosopher, at this time at the summit of his
fame; and like all who entered his circle Dohm
felt himself attracted by his intellectuality, gentleness,
and great wisdom. During his stay in Berlin<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_352" id="Page_352">352</a></span>
he was a regular visitor at the house of Mendelssohn,
who, on Saturday, his day of leisure, always
assembled his friends around him. Every cultivated
Christian who came in contact with Mendelssohn
was pleasantly attracted by him, overcame his bias
against Jews, and experienced mingled admiration
and sympathy for a race that had endured so much
suffering, and produced such a personality. Dohm
had already thrown aside his innate or acquired antipathy
against Jews. His interest in mankind
rested not upon the shifting ground of Christian
love, but upon the firm soil of human culture, characteristic
of the eighteenth century, and included
also this unhappy people. He had already planned
to make the "history of the Jewish nation since the
destruction of their own state" the subject of his
studies.</p>

<p>Dohm evinced his readiness to draw up the memorial
for the Alsatian Jews in a pleasing form, in
conjunction with Mendelssohn. Whilst engaged on
this task, the thought struck him to publish a plea,
not alone for protection for the few, but on behalf
of all the German Jews, who suffered under similar
oppression. Thus originated his never-to-be-forgotten
work, "Upon the Civil Amelioration of the
Condition of the Jews" (finished August, 1781), the
first step towards removing the heavy yoke from
the neck of the Jews. With this pamphlet, like
Lessing with his "Nathan," Dohm partly atoned for
the guilt of the German nation in enslaving and degrading
the Jews. Dohm's apology has no clerical
tinge about it, but was addressed to sober, enlightened
statesmen, and laid particular stress upon the
political advantages. The noble philanthropist
who first pleaded for the emancipation of the negroes
had fewer difficulties to overcome than Dohm
in his efforts for the freedom of the Jews. The
very circumstances that ought to have spoken in
their favor, their intelligence and activity, their<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_353" id="Page_353">353</a></span>
mission to teach Christian nations pure doctrines
on God and morality, their ancient nobility&mdash;all
tended to their detriment. Their intellectual and
energetic habits were described as cunning and
love of gain; their insistence upon the origin of
their dogmas as presumption and infidelity, and
their ancient nobility as pride. It is difficult to
over-estimate the heroism required to speak a word
on their behalf, in face of the numerous prejudices
and sentiments against the Jews prevailing among
all classes of Christian society.</p>

<p>In his apology Dohm, as already noted, omitted
all reference to the religious point of view, and
dwelt solely upon the political and economical
aspect. He started by asserting that it was a universal
conviction that the welfare of states depended
upon increase of population. To this end many
governments spent large sums of money to attract
new citizens from foreign countries. An exception
was made only in the case of Jews. "Almost in all
parts of Europe the tendency of the laws and the
whole constitution of the state is to prevent, as far
as possible, the increase of these unfortunate Asiatic
refugees. Residence is either denied them, or
granted, at a fixed sum, for a short time. A large
proportion of Jews thus find the gates of every town
closed against them; they are inhumanly driven
away from every border, and nothing is left to them
except to starve, or to save themselves from starvation
by crime. Every guild would think itself dishonored
by admitting a Jew as a member; therefore,
in almost every country, the Hebrews are debarred
from handicrafts and mechanical arts. Only men
of rare genius, amidst such oppressive circumstances,
retain courage and serenity to devote themselves to
the fine arts and the sciences. Even the rare men
who attain to a high degree of excellence, as well as
those who are an honor to mankind through their
irreproachable righteousness, meet with respect only<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_354" id="Page_354">354</a></span>
from a few; with the majority the most distinguished
merits of soul and heart can never atone for the
error of 'being a Jew.' What reasons can have induced
the governments of European states to be so
unanimous in this attitude towards the Jewish
nation?" asked Dohm. Is it possible that industrious
and good citizens are less useful to the state,
because they originally came from Asia, and are distinguished
by a beard, by circumcision, and their
form of worship? If the Jewish religion contained
harmful principles, then the exclusion of its adherents
and the contempt felt for them would be justified;
but that is not the case. "The mob, which considers
itself at liberty to deceive a Jew, falsely asserts that,
by his law, he is permitted to cheat the adherents
of another creed, and persecuting priests have spread
stories of the prejudices felt by the Jews, and thus
revealed their own. The chief book of the Jews,
the Law of Moses, is regarded with reverence also
by Christians."</p>

<p>Dohm reviewed the history of the Jews in Europe&mdash;how,
in the first centuries, they had enjoyed full
civil rights in the Roman Empire, and must have
been considered worthy of such privileges&mdash;how
they were degraded and deprived of their rights,
first by the Byzantines, then by the German barbarians,
especially by the Visigoths in Spain. From
the Roman Empire the Jews had brought more culture
than the dominant nations possessed; they
were not brutalized by savage feuds, nor was their
progress retarded by monkish philosophy and superstition.
In Spain amongst Jews and Arabs there
had existed a more remarkable culture than in
Christian Europe. Dohm then reviewed the false
accusations and persecutions against Jews in the
Middle Ages, painting the Christians as cruel barbarians
and the Jews as illustrious martyrs. After
touching upon the condition of the Jews in the
various states, he concluded his delineation with the
words:</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_355" id="Page_355">355</a></span></p>

<blockquote>

<p>"These principles of exclusion, equally opposed to humanity and
politics, which bear the impress of the dark centuries, are unworthy
of the enlightenment of our times, and deserve no longer to be followed.
It is possible that some errors have become so deeply rooted
that they will disappear only in the third or fourth generation. But
this is no argument against beginning to reform now; because,
without such beginning, a better generation can never appear."</p></blockquote>

<p>Dohm suggested a plan whereby the amelioration
of the condition of the Jews might be facilitated, and
his proposals formed a programme for the future.
In the first place, they were to receive equal rights
with all other subjects. In particular, liberty of occupation
and in procuring a livelihood should be
conceded them, so that, by wise precautions, they
would be drawn away from petty trading and usury,
and be attracted to handicrafts, agriculture, arts, and
sciences, all without compulsion. The moral elevation
of the Jews was to be promoted by the foundation
of good schools of their own, or by the admission
of their youth into Christian schools, and by the
elevation of adults in the Jewish Houses of Prayer.
But it should also be impressed upon Christians,
through sermons and other effectual means, that
they were to regard and treat the Jews as brothers
and fellow-men. As a matter of course, Dohm desired
to see freedom in their private religious affairs
granted them: free exercise of religion, the establishment
of synagogues, the appointment of teachers,
maintenance of their poor, if considered wise, under
the supervision of the government. Even the
power of excluding refractory members from the
community should be given them. Dohm, moreover,
pleaded for the continuance, under certain restrictions,
of independent jurisdiction in cases between
Jews, the power to be vested in a tribunal of
rabbis. He wished to debar them from only one
privilege, from filling public offices, or entering the
arena of politics. The ability to undertake these
duties, he thought, was completely lacking in that
generation, and would not manifest itself very conspicuously<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_356" id="Page_356">356</a></span>
in the next. Besides there was a super-abundance
rather than a lack of competent state
officers. For this reason, it would, for the present,
be better both for the state and the Jews, if they
worked in warehouses and behind the plough rather
than in state offices. The immediate future disproved
his doubts.</p>

<p>Dohm foresaw that his programme for the emancipation
of the Jews would meet with violent and
stubborn opposition from the clergy and the theological
school. He therefore submitted it to the
"wisdom of the governments," who at this time
were more inclined to progress and enlightenment
than the people. Dohm was filled with the seriousness
and importance of his task; he was positive
that his proposals would lay the basis not only for
the welfare of the Jews, but also for that of the
states. It is not to be overlooked that Mendelssohn
stood behind him. Even if he did not dictate
the words, yet he breathed into them his spirit of
gentleness and love of mankind, and illumined
the points which were strange and dark to Dohm,
the Christian and political writer. Mendelssohn is,
therefore, to be looked upon, if not as the father,
certainly as the godfather, of Dohm's work.</p>

<p>It was inevitable for such a treatise to create
great excitement in Germany. Must not this demand
to treat Jews as equals have appeared to
respectable Christians as a monstrous thing; as if
the nobility had been asked to place themselves at
the same table with their slaves? Soon after its
appearance, Dohm's work advocating Jewish emancipation
became extraordinarily popular; it was
read, discussed, criticised, and refuted by many,
and approved by only a few. The first rumor was
that Dohm had sold his pen to the Jews for a very
high price, although he had specially entreated protection
for the poor homeless peddlers. Fortune
began to smile upon the Jews after having turned<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_357" id="Page_357">357</a></span>
its back upon them for so many centuries. Scarcely
had the pamphlet appeared, when Emperor Joseph,
the first Austrian ruler to allow himself in some
degree to be guided by moral and humane principles,
having snapt asunder the yoke of the Catholic
Church, and having accorded a Toleration Edict to
the Protestants, issued a series of laws relating to
the Jews, which displayed sincere if rather fierce
philanthropy.</p>

<p>By this new departure (October 19, 1781), the
Jews were permitted to learn handicrafts, arts, and
sciences, and with certain restrictions to devote
themselves to agriculture. The doors of the universities
and academies, hitherto closed to them,
were thrown open. The education of the Jewish
youth was a matter of great interest to this emperor,
who promoted "philosophical morality." He
accordingly decreed the establishment of Jewish
primary and high schools (normal schools), and
forced adults to learn the language of the country,
by decreeing that in future only documents written
in that language would possess legal force. He
considerately removed the risk of all possible attempts
at religious compulsion. In the schools
everything that might be offensive to any creed was
to be omitted from the curriculum. An ordinance
enjoined (November 2) that the Jews were to be
everywhere considered "fellow-men," and all excesses
against them were to be avoided. The
Leibzoll (body-tax), more humiliating to Christians
than to Jews, was also abolished by Joseph II of
glorious memory, in addition to the special law-taxes,
the passport-duty, the night-duty, and all
similar oppressive imposts which had stamped the
Jews as outcasts, for they were now to have equal
rights with the Christian inhabitants (December 19).
Joseph II did not intend to concede complete citizenship
to the Jews; they were still forbidden to
reside in those cities whence Christian intolerance<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_358" id="Page_358">358</a></span>
had hitherto banished them. Even in Vienna Jews
were allowed to dwell only in a few exceptional
cases, on payment of protection-money (toleration-tax),
which protection did not extend to their
grown-up sons. They were not suffered to have a
single public synagogue in Vienna. But Joseph II
annulled a number of vexatious, restrictive regulations,
such as the compulsory wearing of beards,
the prohibition against going out in the forenoon on
Sundays and holidays, or frequenting public pleasure
resorts. The emperor even permitted Jewish
wholesale merchants, notables, and their sons, to
wear swords (January 2, 1782), and especially insisted
that Christians should behave in a friendly
manner towards Jews.</p>

<p>A notable beginning was thus made. The ignominy
of a thousand years, which the uncharitableness
of the Church, the avarice of princes, and
the brutality of nations, had cast upon the race of
Judah, was now partly removed, at least in one
country. Dohm's proposals in consequence met
with earnest consideration; they were not regarded
as ideal dreams, but as political principles worthy of
attention. Scholars, clergymen, statesmen, and
princes began to interest themselves seriously in
the Jewish question. Every thoughtful person in
Germany and elsewhere took one side or the other.
Various opinions and ideas were aired; the most
curious propositions were made. A preacher,
named Schwager, wrote:</p>

<blockquote>

<p>"I have always been averse to hating an unfortunate nation, because
it worships God in another way. I have always lamented that
we have driven the Jews to deceive us by an oppressive political
yoke. For, what else can they do, in order to live? in what other
way can they defray their heavy taxes?"</p></blockquote>

<p>Diez, Dohm's excellent friend, one of the noblest
men of that epoch, afterwards Prussian ambassador
to the Turkish court, thought that Dohm had asked
far too little for the Jews.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_359" id="Page_359">359</a></span></p>

<blockquote>

<p>"You aver most truly," he remarked, "that the present moral depravity
of the Jews is a consequence of their bondage. But to color
the picture, and weaken the reproaches leveled at the Jews, a representation
of the moral depravity of the Christians would have been
useful; certainly it is not less than that of the Jews, and rather the
cause of the latter."</p></blockquote>

<p>John von M√ºller, the talented historian of the
Swiss, with his wide attainments in general history,
also admired the glorious antiquity of the Jews,
praised Dohm's efforts on behalf of the Jews, and
supplied him from the treasures of his knowledge
with new proofs of the unjust and pitiless persecution
of the medi√¶val Jews, and their demoralization
by intolerable tyranny. He wished the writings of
Maimuni, "the Luther of the Jews," to be translated
into one of the European languages.</p>

<p>Naturally, hostile pamphlets were not wanting.
Especially noteworthy was an abusive tract, published
in Prague, entitled "Upon the Inutility of the
Jews in the Kingdoms of Bohemia and Moravia," in
which the author indulged in common insults
against the Jews, and revived all the charges of
poisoning wells, sedition, and other pretexts for
their expulsion. This scurrilous work was so violent,
that Emperor Joseph forbade its circulation
(March 2, 1782). A bitter opponent of the Jews at
this time was Frederick Traugott Hartmann. And
why? Because he had been cheated out of a few
pennies by Jewish hawkers. On account of their
venomous tone, however, these writings harmed the
Jews less than those of the German pedants.</p>

<p>To these belonged a famous scholar of authority,
John David Michaelis, the aged professor at G√∂ttingen.
His range of vision had been widened by
travels and observation, and he had cut himself
adrift from the narrowness of Lutheran theology.
Michaelis was the founder of the rationalist school
of theologians, who resolved the miracles and the
sublimity of the Holy Scriptures into simple natural
facts. Through his "Mosaic Law," and cultivation<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_360" id="Page_360">360</a></span>
of Hebrew grammar and exegesis, he gained high
repute. But Michaelis had exactly that proportion
of unbelief and belief which made him hate the Jews
as the bearers of revealed religion and a miraculous
history, and despise them as antagonists of Christianity.
A Jewish officer in the French army, when
it was stationed in G√∂ttingen, had given but a
grudging salute in return for the slavish obeisances
of the professors, which they held as due to every
Frenchman. This was ground enough for Michaelis
to abominate the Jews one and all, and to affirm
that they were of despicable character. Michaelis
had several years before remarked, on the appearance
of Lessing's drama "The Jew," "that a noble
Jew was a poetic impossibility." Experience had
disproved this assertion through Mendelssohn and
other persons; but a German professor cannot be
mistaken. Michaelis adhered to his opinion that the
Jews were an incorrigible race. Now he condemned
the Jews from a theological point of view, now from
political considerations. It is hard to say whether
it is to be called insensibility, intellectual dullness,
or malice, when Michaelis blurts out with:</p>

<blockquote>

<p>"It seems to me, that here in Germany they (the Jews) already have
everything that they could possibly desire, and I do not know what he
(Dohm) wishes to add thereto. Medicine, philosophy, physics, mathematics,
they are not excluded from,&mdash;and he himself does not wish
them to have offices."</p></blockquote>

<p>He even defended the taking of protection-money
from the Jews.</p>

<p>It cannot be said that the anti-Jewish treatise of
Michaelis injured them at the time, for in no case
would the German princes and people have emancipated them,
had not the imperious progress of
history compelled it. But in after years Michaelis
was employed as an authority against the Jews. The
agitation excited by Dohm, and the views <i>pro</i> and
<i>con</i> had only resulted in forming public opinion
upon Judaism, and this affected not Germany, but<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_361" id="Page_361">361</a></span>
France. Miraculous concatenation of historical
events! The venomous Alsatian district judge
wished to have the Jews of Alsace annihilated, and
through his malice he actually facilitated the liberation
of the Jews in France.</p>

<p>Mendelssohn prudently kept himself in the background
in this movement: he did not desire to
have attention drawn to him as a prejudiced defender
of his brethren in religion and race. He
blessed the outbreak of interest in his unhappy
kinsmen.</p>

<blockquote>

<p>"Blessed be Almighty Providence that has allowed me, at the end
of my days, to see the happy time, when the rights of humanity begin
to be realized in their true extent."</p></blockquote>

<p>However, two things induced him to break silence.
He found that the arrows hurled by Dohm had been
insufficient to pierce the thick-skinned monster of
Jew-hatred.</p>

<blockquote>

<p>"Reason and humanity have raised their voices in vain, for grey-headed
prejudice is deaf."</p></blockquote>

<p>Dohm himself did not appear to him to be free
from the general prejudice, because he admitted that
the Jews of the present day were depraved, useless,
even harmful; therefore he suggested means to improve
them. But Mendelssohn, who knew his co-religionists
better, did not find them so greatly infected
with moral leprosy&mdash;or differing so widely
from Christians of the same class and trade&mdash;as arrogant
Christians in their self-glorification were wont
to assert. In a very clever way Mendelssohn made
not alone the G√∂ttingen scholars Michaelis and
Hartmann, but also Dohm, understand that they had
misconceived the Jewish question.</p>

<blockquote>

<p>"It is wonderful to note how prejudice assumes the forms of every
century in order to act despotically towards us, and place difficulties
in the way of our obtaining civil rights. In superstitious ages we
were said to insult sacred objects out of mere wantonness; to pierce
crucifixes and cause them to bleed; secretly to circumcise children<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_362" id="Page_362">362</a></span>
and stab them in order to feast our eyes upon the sight; to draw
Christian blood for our Passover; to poison wells.</p>

<p>"Now times have changed, calumny no longer makes the desired
impression. Now we, in turn, are upbraided with superstition and
ignorance, lack of moral sentiments, taste, and refined manners, incapacity
for the arts, sciences, and useful pursuits, especially for the
service of war and the state, invincible inclination to cheating, usury,
and lawlessness; all these have taken the place of coarse indictments
against us, to exclude us from the number of useful citizens, and reject
us from the motherly bosom of the state. They tie our hands, and
reproach us that we do not use them.... Reason and the
spirit of research of our century have not yet wiped away all traces
of barbarism in history. Many a legend of the past has obtained
credit, because it has not occurred to any one to cast doubts upon it.
Some are supported by such important authorities that few have the
boldness to look upon them as legends and libels. Even at the present
moment there is many a city of Germany where no circumcised
person, even though he pays duty for his creed, is allowed to issue
forth in open daylight unwatched, lest he kidnap a Christian child or
poison the wells; while during the night he is not trusted under the
strictest surveillance, owing to his well-known intercourse with evil
spirits."</p></blockquote>

<p>The second point in Dohm's memoir which did
not please Mendelssohn was, that it demanded the
recognition of the state for the Jewish religion, inasmuch
as the government was to grant it the right
of excluding unruly members by a sort of excommunication.
This did not harmonize with his conception
of a pure religion. In order to counteract
the errors of Dohm's well-meant apology, and the
obstinate misapprehension of the Jews as much as
possible, Mendelssohn caused one of his young
friends, the physician Marcus Herz, to translate
from the English original the "Vindici√¶ Jud√¶orum"
of Manasseh ben Israel against the numerous slanderous
charges brought against them. He himself
wrote a preface full of luminous, glowing thoughts
(March, 1782), called "The Salvation of the Jews,"
as an appendix to Dohm's work. Manasseh's Apology
was buried in a book little read; Mendelssohn
made its excellent truths known among the cultured
classes, and by a correct elucidation gave them
proper emphasis. In this preface he insisted, that
while the church arrogates the right of inflicting
punishment upon its followers, religion, the true<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_363" id="Page_363">363</a></span>
faith, based upon reason and love of humanity, "requires
neither an arm nor a finger for its purpose;
it concerns only the spirit and the heart. Moreover
it does not drive sinners and renegades from its
doors." Without knowing the whole extent of the
harm caused by it in the course of Jewish history,
Mendelssohn detested the interdicting power. He
therefore adjured the rabbis and elders to give up
their right of excommunicating.</p>

<blockquote>

<p>"Alas! my brethren, you have felt the oppressive yoke of intolerance
only too severely; all the nations of the earth seem hitherto to
have been deluded by the idea that religion can be maintained only by
an iron hand. You, perhaps, have suffered yourselves to be misled
into thinking the same. Oh, my brethren, follow the example of love,
as you have till now followed that of hatred!"</p></blockquote>

<p>Mendelssohn now held so high a position in public
opinion, that every new publication bearing his
name was eagerly read. The fundamental thought
of the preface to Manasseh ben Israel's "Vindication,"
that religion has no rights over its followers
and must not resort to compulsory measures, struck
its readers with astonishment. This had never occurred
to any Christian believer. Enlightened
Christian clergymen, such as Teller, Spalding, Zollikofer,
and others, gradually fell in with the new idea,
and tendered its originator public applause. Bigoted
clerics and obdurate minds, on the other hand, beheld
therein the destruction of religion. "All this
is new and difficult; first principles are denied,"
said they. In Jewish circles also many objections
were made to Mendelssohn's view. It seemed as
if he had suddenly discarded Judaism, which certainly
owns an elaborate system of penalties for religious
crimes and transgressions. From the Christian
camp a pamphlet called "Inquiry into Light and
Truth" was launched against him, which asserted
that he had finally dropped his mask; that he had
embraced the religion of love, and turned his back
upon his native faith, which execrates and punishes.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_364" id="Page_364">364</a></span>
A second time Mendelssohn was compelled to
emerge from his retirement, and give his views upon
religion. This he did in a work entitled "Jerusalem,"
or "Upon Ecclesiastical Power and Judaism"
(spring, 1783), whose purity of contents and
form is a memorial of his lofty genius. The gentleness
that breathes through this book, the
warmth of conviction, the frankness of utterance, its
childlike ingenuousness, yet profoundly thoughtful
train of ideas, the graceful style which renders even
dry discussion enjoyable&mdash;all these qualities earned
contemporary approval for this work, and will always
assure it a place in literature. At the time it excited
great surprise. It had been believed, that, owing
to his ideas upon religion and Judaism, Mendelssohn,
if he had not entirely broken away from Judaism,
had yet declared many things therein to be
worthless. He now showed that he was an ardent
Jew, and would not yield a tittle of existing Judaism,
either rabbinical or biblical; that he, in fact, claimed
the highest privileges for it. All this was in accord
with his peculiar method of thought.</p>

<p>Judaism recognizes the freedom of religious convictions.
Original, pure Judaism, therefore, contains
no binding articles of belief, no symbolical books, by
which the faithful were compelled to swear and
affirm their incumbent duty. Judaism prescribes
not faith, but knowledge, and it urges that its doctrines
be taken to heart. In this despised religion
everyone may think, opine, and err as he pleases,
without incurring the guilt of heresy. Its right of
inflicting punishment begins only when evil thoughts
become acts. Why? Because Judaism is not revealed
religion, but revealed legislation. Its first
precept is not, "thou shalt believe or not believe,"
but, "thou shalt do or abstain from doing."</p>

<blockquote>

<p>"In the divinely-ordained constitution, state and religion are one.
Not unbelief, false teaching, and error, but wicked offenses against
the principles of the state and the national constitution are chastised.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_365" id="Page_365">365</a></span>
With the destruction of the Temple, <i>i. e.</i>, with the downfall of the
state, all corporal and capital punishment, as well as money fines,
ceased. The national bonds were dissolved; religious trespasses
were no longer crimes against the state, and religion, as such, knows
no punishments."</p></blockquote>

<p>For those who seriously or jestingly had reported
that Mendelssohn had separated from Judaism, he
laid stress upon two points not wholly germane to
his subject, viz., that the so-called ceremonial law
of Judaism is likewise, indeed particularly, of divine
origin, and that its obligatory character must continue
"until it pleases the Supreme to abrogate it as
plainly and publicly as it was revealed."</p>

<p>The effect of this detailed apology was greater
than Mendelssohn could have expected. Instead
of defending himself he had come forward as an
accuser, and in a manner at once gentle and forcible
he had laid bare the hateful ulcers of the church and
state constitution. Two authoritative representatives
of the age pronounced flattering opinions upon
him and the subject which he was discussing. Kant,
who had already testified to his greatness of thought,
wrote that he had read "Jerusalem" with admiration
for its keenness of argument, its refinement, and
cleverness of composition.</p>

<blockquote>

<p>"I consider this book the herald of a great reform, which will
affect not alone your nation, but also others. You have succeeded
in combining your religion with such a degree of freedom of conscience
as was never imagined possible, and of which no other faith
can boast. You have, at the same time, so thoroughly and clearly
demonstrated the necessity of unlimited liberty of conscience in every
religion, that ultimately our Church will also be led to reflect how to
remove from its midst everything that disturbs and oppresses conscience,
which will finally unite all men in their view of the essential
points of religion."</p></blockquote>

<p>Michaelis, the rationalistic anti-Semite, stood baffled,
embarrassed, and ashamed before the bold
ideas of the "Jerusalem." Judaism, which he had
scornfully disdained, now fearlessly and victoriously
raised its head. The Jew Mendelssohn, whom he
would not have trusted with a penny, appeared the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_366" id="Page_366">366</a></span>
incarnation of conscientiousness and wisdom.
Michaelis was sorely perplexed in passing judgment
upon this remarkable work. He was obliged
to admit many things. Thus, without selfish motives,
impelled only by circumstances, Mendelssohn
glorified Judaism, and shook off disgrace from his
people. In the meantime Dohm was aiding him.
He continued to expound Judaism in the most favorable
light, and refute all objections, the honest as
well as the malicious ones; he had come to regard
the quarrel as his own. But Dohm effected most
by enlisting through his writings in favor of Jews
the sympathies of Mirabeau, a man with shoulders
strong enough to bear a new system of the world,
and he continued the work of Dohm.</p>

<p>At the same time, and in the same way, that is,
indirectly, Mendelssohn again urged the internal
rejuvenescence of the Jews, which was to accompany
their emancipation. From modesty or discretion,
he would not come to the front; he had
stimulated Dohm to do battle for their emancipation,
and for their regeneration he brought forward
another friend, who appeared born for the task.
Owing to Mendelssohn, Wessely became a historical
personage, who worked with all his energy for
the improvement of the Jews, completing the deficiency
of Mendelssohn's retiring character. Hartwig
(Hartog, Naphtali-Herz) Wessely (born in
Hamburg, 1725; died in the same town, 1805) was
of a peculiar disposition, combining elements not
often associated. His grandfather had established
a manufactory for arms in Holstein, and had been a
commercial councilor and royal resident. His
father also conducted an important business, and
had frequent intercourse with so-called great people.
In this way Hartwig Wessely came with his
father to Copenhagen, where a Portuguese congregation,
and also a few German Jews had settled.
His early education was the same as that of most<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_367" id="Page_367">367</a></span>
boys of that time; he learnt to read Hebrew
mechanically, and to mis-translate the Bible, to be
launched, a boy of nine, into the labyrinth of the
Talmud. But a traveling grammarian, Solomon
Hanau, promoted the development of the germs
within him, and inspired him with love for the
Hebrew language. His labor was not in vain.
The seed sown by Hanau was to bear thousand-fold
fruit. Wessely's chief interest was the study of the
Holy Writings in the original tongue; it was the
aim of his life to understand them from all points of
view. Owing to his father's frequent contact with
non-Jewish circles, in the course of business,
Wessely obtained an insight into actual life, and
absorbed other branches of knowledge, the modern
languages, geography, history, descriptions of travels.
These only served as auxiliary sciences to be
employed in his special study of the Scriptures, and
by their means to penetrate deeper into their
thought and spirit. Like Mendelssohn, Wessely
was self-taught. Very early he developed taste, a
sense for beauty, feeling for purity of speech and
form, and repugnance to the mixed dialects and the
jargon commonly used among German Jews.</p>

<p>Wessely again resembled Mendelssohn in character,
distinguished as he was by strict conscientiousness
and elevated feelings of honor. In him,
too, thoughts, sentiments, words, and deeds, showed
no discrepancy. He was of deep, pure piety, an
unswerving adherent to Judaism. His nature, however,
did not display the gentle pliancy of Mendelssohn's.
He was stiff and pedantic, more inclined to
juggle with words and split hairs than to think
deeply, and he had no correct idea of the action of
world-moving forces. All his life Wessely remained
a visionary, and saw the events of the real world
through colored glasses. In one way Wessely was
apparently superior to Mendelssohn; he was a
poet. In reality, however, he only possessed uncommon<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_368" id="Page_368">368</a></span>
facility and skill in making beautiful, well-sounding
verses of blameless refinement, of graceful
symmetrical smoothness, and accurate construction.</p>

<p>Wessely was greatly charmed by the laws of
Emperor Joseph in favor of the Jews, especially by
the command to erect schools; he beheld therein
the dawn of a golden age for the Jews, whilst Mendelssohn,
with his keen perception, from the first
did not expect great results. He remarks, "It is
perhaps only a passing idea, without any substance,
or, as some fear, it has a financial purpose."
Wessely, however, composed a glowing hymn of
praise to the noble rule and the magnanimity of
Emperor Joseph. As soon as he was informed
that the rigidly orthodox party in Vienna regretted
the order to establish schools as an interference
with their liberty of conscience, he addressed a Hebrew
letter (March, 1782), called "Words of Peace
and Truth," to the Austrian congregations, exhorting
them to welcome it as a benefit, to rejoice in it,
and at once execute it. He explained that it was a
religious duty of the Jews, recommended even by
the Talmud, to acquire general culture, that the
latter must even precede a knowledge of religion,
and that only by such means could they remove the
disgrace which, owing to their ignorance, had
weighed upon them for so long a time. Wessely
emphasized the necessity of banishing the barbarous
jargon from the midst of the Jews, and of cultivating
a pure, euphonious language. He sketched a plan
of instruction in his letter, showing how the Jewish
youth should be led, step by step, from elementary
subjects to the study of the Talmud. This letter,
written with fervor, impressive eloquence, and in a
beautiful Hebrew style, could not have failed to
produce great effect, had not Wessely, in his fantastic
manner, recommended that all Jewish youths,
without distinction of talents and future profession
should be taught, not only history and geography<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_369" id="Page_369">369</a></span>
but also natural sciences, astronomy, and religious
philosophy, because only by this preliminary knowledge
could a thorough understanding of Holy
Writ and of Judaism be acquired!</p>

<p>This epistle bore him both sweet and bitter fruit.
The community of Trieste, chiefly comprising Italian
and Portuguese Jews, who, unlike the Germans, did
not consider culture as heresy, had applied to the
governor, Count Zinzendorf, declaring their readiness
to establish a normal school, and begging him
to advise them how they might procure text books
on religion and ethics. Zinzendorf directed them
to Mendelssohn, whose celebrated name had penetrated
to that distant place. Accordingly, Joseph
Chayim Gala√Øgo, in the name of the congregation
of Trieste, addressed a petition to the Jewish sage
of Berlin for his writings. On this occasion, Mendelssohn
called the attention of the people of Trieste
to his friend Wessely and to his circular letter, recommending
the founding of Jewish schools, and the
community forthwith entered into negotiations with
him. Thus his fervent words met with early
encouragement.</p>

<p>From the strictly pious people, however, a storm
now broke out against him. They were particularly
indignant at his hearty approval of Emperor Joseph's
reforms. The unamiable manner in which princes
were wont to concede freedom, the force brought to
bear upon the Jews, a natural aversion to forsake
the past, the legitimate fear that through school education
and partial emancipation young men would
be seduced from Judaism, and that the instruction
given at the normal schools would supersede the
study of the Talmud&mdash;all these things had induced
the rabbis and the representatives of tradition to
oppose the reforming Jewish ordinances of Emperor
Joseph. Besides, men of doubtful piety, such as
Herz Homberg, eagerly pressed forward to obtain
appointments at the newly-founded training schools,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_370" id="Page_370">370</a></span>
and to tempt the youthful students to innovations.
There were, to be sure, intelligent men, especially in
Prague, who greeted the new laws as salutary measures,
and hoped that by these means the Jews would
rise out of their wretched, demoralized condition.
But this minority was denounced by the orthodox
as innovators and triflers. Religious simplicity,
which at every puff of wind feared the downfall of
the edifice of faith, and the desire of gain, which
fattened upon ignorance, and the perverse method
of instruction in a corrupt dialect, worked hand in
hand to predispose the communities against school
reforms. Wessely destroyed the whole opposition
with one blow. He who had hitherto been respected
as an orthodox believer, now supported the new
order of things. Further, in his incautious way, he
had quoted the Talmudical sentence, "A Talmudist
who does not possess knowledge (general culture),
is uglier than a carcass." This expression greatly
angered the orthodox. The Austrian rabbis dared
not attack him openly, because he had only followed
the emperor in his ideas. They appear therefore
to have incited certain Polish rabbis to condemn his
circular letter and excommunicate him.</p>

<p>Although the zealots were without support from
Berlin, they continued in their heretic-hunting, causing
the pulpits to re-echo with imprecations against
Wessely; and in Lissa his letter was publicly burnt.
He had the bitter experience of standing alone in
this conflict. None of his adherents publicly sided
with him, although he was contending for a just cause
by noble methods and in a most becoming manner.
Mendelssohn did not like such disputes, and at this
time was suffering too much, bodily and mentally,
to take part. Thus Wessely had to conduct his
own defense. He published a second letter (April
24), supposed to be addressed to the Trieste congregation,
in which he again dwelt upon the importance
of regular instruction, and of the abolition<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_371" id="Page_371">371</a></span>
of old practices, and disproved the charges against
him. Gentle and forbearing as he was, he avoided
retorting severely upon his opponents; but he permitted
words of censure against orthodoxy and the
one-sided, perverse Talmudic tendency to slip from
him. It was, indeed, the irony of history, that the
most orthodox among the followers of Mendelssohn,
without wishing it, opened fire on Rabbinism, as the
Kabbalist Jacob Emden had given the first violent
blow to the Kabbala. By and by, several Italian
rabbis of Trieste, Ferrara, and Venice, spoke in
favor of Wessely, and recommended culture, although
they were unable to bridge over the chasm
between it and Rabbinism. Wessely was victorious;
and the opposing rabbis laid down their arms.
Schools for regular instruction arose here and there,
even in Prague. But the strict Talmudists were
right. Their suspicions foreboded the future more
truly than Mendelssohn's and Wessely's confidence.
The old rigid form of Judaism could no more assert
itself. Both these men, who had felt so much at
ease in the old structure, and wished only to see it
cleansed here and there from cobwebs and fungus
growths, contributed to sap its foundations.</p>

<p>Wessely, ever deserted by fortune, lived to see
this decay with weeping eyes. Mendelssohn, more
fortunate, was spared this pain. Death called him
away in time, before he perceived that his circle,
even his own daughters, treated with contemptuous
scorn and rejected what his heart held to be most
sacred, and what he so earnestly strove to glorify.
Had he lived ten years longer, even his wisdom
would perhaps not have availed him to tide over
this anguish. He who without a trace of romance
had led an ideal life, died ideally transfigured, at the
right moment. The friendship and the philosophy
which had elevated his life and brought him fame
broke his heart. When Mendelssohn was about
to raise a memorial to his unforgotten friend, to<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_372" id="Page_372">372</a></span>
show him in his true greatness to future generations,
he learned from Jacobi that shortly before
his death Lessing had manifested a decided
liking for the philosophy of Spinoza. "Lessing a
Spinozist!" This pierced Mendelssohn's heart as
with a spear. Nothing was so distasteful to him as
the pantheistic system of Spinoza, which denied a
personal God, Providence, and Immortality, ideas
with which Mendelssohn's soul was bound up.
That Lessing should have entertained such convictions,
and that he, his bosom friend, should
know nothing whatsoever about them! Jealousy
that Lessing had communicated to others the secret
so carefully concealed from himself, and deep disappointment
that his friend had not shared his own
convictions took possession of Mendelssohn. He
suspected, that his philosophy, if it was true that
Lessing had not been pleased with it, would become
obsolete, and be thrust aside. His whole being
rose in resistance against such doubts. These
thoughts robbed the last years of his life of rest,
made him passionate, excited, feverish. While
composing his work in refutation of Jacobi's, "To
the Friends of Lessing," excitement so overpowered
him that it brought on his death (January 4, 1786).
This ideal death for friendship and wisdom worthily
concluded his life, and showed him to posterity as
he appeared to his numerous friends and admirers,
an upright, honest man, in whom was neither falsehood
nor guile. Almost the entire population of
the Prussian capital, and many earnest men in Germany
and beyond its borders mourned the man
who, forty years before, with heavy heart had
knocked at one of the gates of Berlin, in fear that
the Christian or the Jewish beadle would drive him
away. The attempt of his Christian friends, Nicolai,
Biester, and Engel, the tutor of the Crown
Prince Frederick William III, in conjunction with
Jewish admirers, to erect a statue to Mendelssohn<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_373" id="Page_373">373</a></span>
in the Opera Square next to those of Leibnitz,
Lambert, and Sulzer, although it did not meet with
approval, characterizes the progress of the time.
The deformed son of the so-called "Ten Commandments
writer" of Dessau had become an ornament
to the city of Berlin.</p>

<p>As soon as an historical work has performed its
service, and is to undergo a change, new phenomena
arise from various sides, and assume a
hostile attitude, either to alter or destroy it. It
might have been foreseen that the rejuvenescence
of the Jewish race, for which Mendelssohn had leveled
the way, would produce a transformation and
decomposition of religious habits among Jews. The
innovators desired this, and hoped, and strove for it;
the old orthodox party suspected and dreaded it.
The process of dissolution was brought about also in
another way, upon another scene, under entirely
different conditions, and by other means, and this
could not have been foreseen. There arose in Poland
a new Essenism, with forms similar to those of
the ancient cult, with ablutions and baths, white
garments, miraculous cures, and prophetic visions.
Like the old movement, it originated in ultra-piety,
but soon turned against its own parent, and perhaps
hides within itself germs of a peculiar kind, which,
being in course of development, cannot be defined.
It seems remarkable that, at the time when Mendelssohn<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_375" id="Page_375">375</a></span>
declared rational thought to be the essence
of Judaism, and founded, as it were, a widely-extended
order of enlightened men, another banner was
unfurled, the adherents of which announced the
grossest superstition to be the fundamental principle
of Judaism, and formed an order of wonder-seeking
confederates. Both these new bodies took up a
hostile position to traditional Judaism, and created
a rupture. History in its generative power is as
manifold and puzzling as nature. It produces in
close proximity healing herbs and poisonous plants,
lovely flowers and hideous parasites. Reason and
unreason seemed to have entered into a covenant
to shatter the gigantic structure of Talmudic Judaism.
The attempt once before made by history,
to subvert Judaism by the contemporaneous existence
of Spinoza and Sabbata√Ø Zevi, was now repeated
by the simultaneous attacks of representatives
of reason and unreason. Enlightenment and
Kabbalistic mysticism joined hands to commence
the work of destruction. Mendelssohn and Israel
Baalshem, what contrasts! Yet both unconsciously
undermined the basis of Talmudic Judaism. The
origin of the new Chassidim, who had already become
numerous, and who sprang up very rapidly, is
not so clear as the movement started by Mendelssohn.
The new sect, a daughter of darkness, was
born in gloom, and even to-day proceeds stealthily
on its mysterious way. Only a few circumstances
which contributed to its rise and propagation are
known.</p>

<p>The founders of the new Chassidism were Israel
of Miedziboz (born about 1698; died 1759) and
Beer of Mizricz (born about 1700; died 1772). The
former received, alike from his admirers and his antagonists,
the surname of "The Wonderworker by
means of Invocations in the Name of God," Baalshem,
or Baal-Shemtob, in the customary abbreviated
form, Besht. As ugly as the name, Besht, was the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_376" id="Page_376">376</a></span>
form of the founder and the order that he called
into existence. The Graces did not sit by his
cradle, but the spirit of belief in wonderworking,
and his brain was so filled with fantastic images
that he could not distinguish them from real, tangible
beings. The experiences of Israel's youth are
unknown. So much, however, is certain; he was
left an orphan, poor and neglected, early in life, and
passed a great portion of his youth in the forests
and caves of the Carpathian mountains. The spurs
of the Carpathian hills were his teachers. Here he
learnt what he would not have acquired in the dark,
narrow, dirty hovels called schools in Poland&mdash;namely,
to understand the tongue which nature
speaks. The spirits of the mountains and the fountains
whispered secrets to him. Here he also
learned, probably from the peasant women who
gathered herbs on the mountain-tops and on the
edges of rivers, the use of plants as remedies. As
they did not trust to the healing power of nature,
but added conjurations and invocations to good and
evil spirits, Israel also accustomed himself to this
method of cure. He became a miracle-doctor.
Necessity, too, was his teacher; it taught him to
pray. How often, in his forsaken and orphaned
condition, may he have suffered from want even of
dry bread, how often may he have been surrounded
by real or imaginary dangers! In his distress he
prayed in the usual forms of the synagogue; but he
spoke his words with fervor and intense devotion,
or cried them aloud in the solitude of the mountains.
His audible prayer awakened the echoes of the
mountains, which appeared as an answer to his supplications.
He seems to have been often in a state
of rapture, and to have induced this condition by
frantic movements of the whole body while praying.
This agitation drove the blood to his head, made
his eyes glitter, and wrought both body and soul
into such a condition of over-excitement that he felt<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_377" id="Page_377">377</a></span>
a deadly weakness come over him. Was this
magnetic tension of the soul caused by the motions
and the shouting, singing, and praying?</p>

<p>Israel Baalshem asserted that, in consequence of
these bodily agitations and this intense devotion, he
often caught a glimpse of infinity. His soul soared
upward to the world of light, heard and saw Divine
secrets and revelations, entered into conversation
with sublime spirits, and by their intervention could
secure the grace of God and prosperity, and especially
avert impending calamities. Israel Miedziboz
also boasted that he could see into the future, as
secrets were unveiled to him. Was this a deliberate
boast, self-deception, or merely an over-estimation
of morbid feelings? There are persons, times,
and places, in which the line of demarcation between
trickery and self-delusion cannot be distinguished.
In Poland, in Baalshem's time, with the
terrible mental strain created by the Kabbala in
connection with the Sabbatian fraud, the feverish
expectation of imminent Messianic redemption, everything
was possible and everything credible. In
that land the fancy of both Jews and Christians
moved among extraordinary and supernatural phenomena
as in its natural element. Israel steadfastly
and firmly believed in the visions seen when
he was under mental and physical excitement; he
believed in the power of his prayers. In his delusion
he blasphemously declared that prayer is a
kind of marriage union (Zivug) of man with the
Godhead (Shechina), upon which he must enter
whilst in a state of excitement. Equipped with alleged
higher knowledge of secret remedies and the
spirit world, to which he thought he had attained
through Divine grace, Israel entered the society of
men to prove his higher gifts. It must be acknowledged
to his credit that he never misused these talents.
He did not make a trade of them, nor seek to
earn his livelihood with them. At first he followed<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_378" id="Page_378">378</a></span>
the humble occupation of a wagoner, afterwards he
dealt in horses, and when his means permitted it he
kept a tavern.</p>

<p>Occasionally, when specially requested, he employed
his miraculous remedies, and thereby gained
so great a reputation that he was consulted even by
Polish nobles. He became conspicuous by his
noisy, delirious praying, which must have so transfigured
him that men did not recognize the wagoner
or horse-dealer whom they knew. He was admired
for his revelation of secrets. In Poland not only
the unlearned and the Jews considered such gifts
and miracles possible; the Jesuits and the Kabbalists
had stultified the Christians and the Jews of
their country, and plunged them into a state of primitive
barbarism.</p>

<p>It would have been a remarkable thing if such a
wonder-doctor, who appeared to have intercourse
with the spirit world, had not found adherents, but
he can hardly have designed the formation of a new
sect. He was joined by persons of a similar disposition
to his own, who felt a religious impulse, which
could not be satisfied, they thought, by a rigorous,
penitential life, or by mechanical repetition of prescribed
prayers. They joined Israel, in Miedziboz,
to pray with devotion, <i>i. e.</i>, in a sing-song tune, clapping
their hands, bowing, jumping, gesticulating, and
uttering cries. At almost the same time there
arose, in Wales, a Christian sect called "the Jumpers,"
who resorted to similar movements during
prayer, and induced trances and mesmeric dreams.
At the same time there was established, in North
America, the sect of the Shakers, by an Irish girl,
Johanna Lee, who likewise in the delirium of prayer
pursued mystic Messianic phantoms. Israel need
not have been a trickster to obtain followers. Mysticism
and madness are contagious. He particularly
attracted men who desired to lead a free and merry
life, at the same time hoping to reach a lofty aim,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_379" id="Page_379">379</a></span>
and to live assured of the nearness of God in serenity
and calmness, and to advance the Messianic
future. They did not need to pore over Talmudical
folios in order to attain to higher piety.</p>

<p>It became the fashion in neo-Chassidean circles to
scoff at the Talmudists. Because the latter mocked
at the unlearned chief of the new order, who had a
following without belonging to the guild of Talmudists,
without having been initiated into the Talmud
and its appendages, the Chassidim depreciated the
study of the Talmud, avowing that it was not able
to promote a truly godly life. Covert war existed
between the neo-Chassidim and the Rabbanites; the
latter could not, however, harm their opponents so
long as Israel's adherents did not depart from existing
Judaism. After the death of the founder, when
barbarism and degeneracy increased, the feud grew
into a complete rupture under Beer of Mizricz.</p>

<p>Dob Beer (or Berish) was no visionary like Israel,
but possessed the faculty of clear insight into the
condition of men's minds. He was thus able to
render the mind and will of others subservient to
him. Although he joined the new movement only
a short time before Israel's death, yet, whether at
his suggestion or not, Israel's son and sons-in-law
were passed over, and Beer was made Israel's successor
in the leadership of the neo-Chassidean community.
Beer, who transferred the center to Mizricz&mdash;a
village in Volhynia&mdash;was superior to his
master in many points. He was well read in Talmudical
and Kabbalistic writings, was a fluent
preacher (Maggid), who, to further his purpose,
could make the most far-fetched biblical verses, as
also Agadic and Zoharic expressions, harmonize,
and thus surprise his audience. He removed from
the Chassidim the stigma of ignorance, especially
disgraceful in Poland, and secured an accession of
supporters. He had a commanding appearance, did
not mingle with the people, but lived the whole<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_380" id="Page_380">380</a></span>
week secluded in a small room&mdash;only accessible to
his confidants&mdash;and thus acquired the renown of
mysterious intercourse with the heavenly world.
Only on the Sabbath did he show himself to all who
longed to be favored with his sight. On this day
he appeared splendidly attired in satin, his outer
garment, his shoes, and even his snuff-box being
white, the color signifying grace in the Kabbalistic
language. On this day, in accordance with the custom
introduced by Israel Besht, he offered up
prayers together with his friends, with the strangers
who had made a pilgrimage to him, with the new
members, and those curious to see the Kabbalistic
saint and wonderworker. To produce the joyous
state of mind necessary to devout prayer, Beer indulged
in vulgar jokes, whereby the merriment of
the bystanders was aroused; for instance, he would
joke with one of the circle, and throw him down.
In the midst of this child's play he would suddenly
cry out, "Now serve the Lord with gladness."</p>

<p>Under Beer's guidance, the constitution of Chassidism
remained apparently in the same form as
under his predecessor: fervent, convulsive praying,
inspiration (Hithlahabuth), miraculous cures, and
revelations of the future. But as these actions did
not, as with Israel, flow from a peculiar or abnormal
state of mind, they could only be imitated&mdash;artifice
or illusion had to supply what nature withheld. It
was an accepted fact that the Chassidean leader, or
Zaddik, the perfectly pious man, had to be enthusiastic
in prayer, had to have ecstatic dreams and
visions. How can a clever plotter appear inspired?
Alcohol, so much liked in Poland, now had to take
the place of the inspiring demon. Beer had not
the knowledge of remedial herbs, which his teacher
had obtained in the Carpathian mountains. He,
therefore, devoted himself to medicine, and if his
remedies did not avail, then the sick person died of
his sinfulness. To predict the future was a more<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_381" id="Page_381">381</a></span>
difficult task, yet it had to be accomplished; his
reputation as a thaumaturgist depended upon it.
Beer was equal to the emergency. Among his intimates
were expert spies, worthy of serving in the
secret police. They discovered many secrets, and
told them to their leader; thus he was enabled to
assume an appearance of omniscience. Or his
emissaries committed robberies; if the victims
came to the "Saint" in his hermitage to find them
out, he was able to indicate the exact spot where
the missing articles were lying. If strangers, attracted
by his fame, came to see him, they were not
admitted, as mentioned, until the following Saturday,
to take part in the Chassidean witches' Sabbath.
Meantime his spies, by artful questions and other
means, gleaned a knowledge of the affairs and secret
desires of these strangers, and communicated
them to the Zaddik. In the first interview Beer, in
a seemingly casual manner, was able, in a skillfully
arranged discourse, to bring in allusions to these
strangers, whereby they would be convinced that he
had looked into their hearts, and knew their past.
By these and similar contrivances, he succeeded in
asserting himself as omniscient, and increasing the
number of his followers. Every new convert testified
to his Divine inspiration, and induced others to
join.</p>

<p>In order to strengthen respect for him, Beer propounded
a theory, which in its logical application is
calculated to promote most harmful consequences.
Supported by the Kabbalistic formula, that "the
righteous or the pious man is the foundation of the
world," he magnified the importance of the Zaddik,
or the Chassidean chief, to such an extent that it
became blasphemy. "A Zaddik is not alone the
most perfect and sinless human being, he is not
alone Moses, but the representative of God and
His image." All and everything that the Zaddik
does and thinks has a decided influence upon the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_382" id="Page_382">382</a></span>
upper and lower worlds. The Deity reveals Himself
especially in the acts of the Zaddik; even his
most trifling deeds are to be considered important.
The way he wears his clothes, ties his shoes,
smokes his pipe, whether he delivers profound addresses,
or indulges in silly jokes&mdash;everything
bears a close relation to the Deity, and is of as
much moment as the fulfillment of a religious duty.
Even when drawing inspiration from the bottle, he
is swaying the upper and nether worlds. All these
absurd fancies owed their origin to the superstitious
doctrines of the Kabbala, which, in spite of the
unspeakable confusion they had wrought through
Sabbata√Ø Zevi and Frank, in spite of the opposition
which their chief exponent, the Zohar, had encountered
at about this time at the hands of Jacob Emden,
still clouded the brains of the Polish Jews.
According to this theory, the Zaddik, <i>i. e.</i>, Berish
Mizricz, was the embodiment of power and splendor
upon earth. In his "St√ºbel," or "Hermitage," <i>i. e.</i>,
in his dirty little retired chamber, he considered
himself as great as the papal vicar of God upon
earth in his magnificent palace. The Zaddik was
also to bear himself proudly towards men; all this
was "for the glory of God." It was a sort of Catholicism
within Judaism.</p>

<p>Beer's idea, however, was not meant to remain
idle and unfruitful, but to bring him honor and
revenue. While the Zaddik cared for the conduct
of the world, for the obtaining of heavenly grace,
and especially for Israel's preservation and glorification,
his adherents had to cultivate three kinds of
virtues. It was their duty to draw nigh to him, to
enjoy the sight of him, and from time to time to
make pilgrimages to him. Further, they were to
confess their sins to him. By these means alone
could they hope for pardon of their iniquities. Finally,
they had to bring him presents, rich gifts,
which he knew how to employ to the best advantage.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_383" id="Page_383">383</a></span>
It was also incumbent upon them to attend
to his personal wants. It seems like a return to the
days of the priests of Baal, so vulgar and disgusting
do these perversities appear. The saddest part of
all is that this teaching, worthy of a fetish worshiping
people, met with approbation in Poland, the
country distinguished by cumbersome knowledge of
Jewish literature. It was just this excess, this over-activity
of the spiritual digestive apparatus, that
produced such lamentable phenomena. The intellect
of the Polish Jews had been so over-excited,
that the coarsest things were more pleasing to them
than what was refined.</p>

<p>Beer despatched abroad as his apostles bombastic
preachers who seasoned his injurious teachings
with distorted citations from the Scriptures. Simple-minded
men, rogues, and idlers, of whom there
were so many in Poland, attached themselves to the
new Chassidim; the first from inclination to enthusiasm
and belief in miracles; the cunning, in order
to procure money in an easy way, and lead a pleasant
existence; and the idlers, because in the court
of the Zaddik they found occupation, and gratified
their curiosity. If such idlers were asked what they
were thinking of, as they strolled about pipe in
mouth, they would reply with seriousness, "We are
meditating upon God." The simple people, however,
who hoped to win bliss through the Chassidean
discipline, engaged continually in prayer, until
through exhaustion they dropped unconscious.</p>

<p>Neo-Chassidism was favored by two circumstances,
the fraternization of the members and the
dryness and fossilized character of Talmudic study
as carried on in Poland for more than a century.
At the outset the Chassidim formed a kind of
brotherhood, not indeed with a common purse, as
among their prototypes, the Essenes and the Jud√¶o-Christians,
but having regard to the wants of needy
members. Owing to the closeness of their union,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_384" id="Page_384">384</a></span>
their spying system, and their energy, it was easy
for them to provide for those who lacked employment
or food. On New Year and the Day of
Atonement people, even those who dwelt at long
distances, undertook pilgrimages to the Zaddik, as
formerly to the Temple, and left their wives and
children to pass the so-called holy days in the company
of their chief, to be edified by his presence and
actions. Here the Chassidean disciples learned to
know one another, discussed local affairs, and rendered
mutual help. Well-to-do merchants found
opportunity at these assemblies, in conversation
with fellow-believers, upon whose fidelity and brotherly
attachment they could rely, to discover fresh
sources of income. Fathers of marriageable daughters
sought and easily found husbands for them,
which at that time in Poland was considered a highly
important matter. The common meals on the
afternoons of Saturdays and the holidays strengthened
the bonds of loyalty and affection among
them. How could meals for so many guests be
provided? The wealthy Chassidim regarded it as
a duty to support the Zaddik liberally. A special
source of income was the superstitious belief prevalent
among the Chassidim that the Zaddik for
certain sums (Pidion, Redemption) could ward off
threatening perils and cure deadly diseases. Pressure
was brought to bear upon wealthy but weak-minded
persons, and they were terrified into believing
that they could escape impending calamities
only by rich gifts. Whoever desired to enter upon
a hazardous transaction consulted the Zaddik as an
oracle, and had to pay for his counsel. The cunning
Chassidim knew everything, were ready with counsel
in any emergency, and by their craftiness were
able to afford real assistance. The Zaddik, however
miserly he might be, had to assist the poor
and distressed with his revenues. Thus every
member received help here. Full of enthusiasm<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_385" id="Page_385">385</a></span>
they returned home from their journey;
the feeling that they belonged to a brotherhood
elevated them, and they ardently looked forward
to the return of the holy time. The poor and
forsaken, the fanatical and the unprincipled, could
not do better than join this union, this easy-going
yet religious order.</p>

<p>Earnest men, also, desirous of satisfying their
spiritual wants, felt themselves attracted to the
Chassidim. Rabbinical Judaism, as known in Poland,
offered no sort of religious comfort. Its representatives
placed the highest value upon the dialectic,
artificial exposition of the Talmud and its
commentaries. Actual necessity had besides caused
that portion of the Talmud which treated of civil
law to be closely studied, as the rabbis exercised
civil jurisdiction over their flocks. Fine-spun decisions
of new, complicated legal points occupied the
doctors of the Talmud day and night. Moreover,
this hair-splitting was considered sublimest piety,
and superseded everything else. If any one solved
an intricate Talmudic question, or discovered
something new, called Torah, he felt self-satisfied,
and assured of his felicity hereafter. All other
objects, the impulse to devotion, prayer, and emotion,
or interest in the moral condition of the community,
were secondary matters, to which scarcely
any attention was paid. The mental exercise of
making logical deductions from the Talmud, or
more correctly from the laws of Mine and Thine,
choked all other intellectual pursuits in Poland.
Religious ceremonies had degenerated, both
amongst Talmudists and the unlearned, into meaningless
usages, and prayer into mere lip-service.
To men of feeling this aridity of Talmudic study,
together with the love of debate, and the dogmatism
and pride of the rabbis arising from it, were
repellent, and they flung themselves into the arms
of the new order, which allowed so much play for<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_386" id="Page_386">386</a></span>
the fancy and the emotions. Especially preachers,
semi-Talmudists who were looked upon and treated
by erudite rabbi-Talmudists as inferior and contemptible,
who eked out a wretched living, or
almost starved, leagued themselves with the neo-Chassidim,
because among them their talents of
preaching were appreciated, and they could obtain
an honorable position, and be secured against need.
By the accession of such elements the circle of neo-Chassidim
became daily augmented. Almost in
every town lived followers of the new school, who
occasionally had intercourse with their brother-members
and their chief.</p>

<p>With advancing strength the antipathy of the
neo-Chassidim to the rabbis and Talmudists increased.
Without being aware of it they formed a
new sect, which scorned intercourse with the Talmud
Jews. With Beer at their head, they felt
themselves strong enough to introduce an innovation,
which would naturally bring down the anger of
the rabbis upon them. Since prayer and the rites
of Divine service were the chief consideration for
them, they did not trouble themselves about the
prescriptions of the ritual law as to how many
prayers should be said, nor at what time the different
services should commence and terminate, but
were entirely guided by the feeling of the moment.
Through their daily ablutions, baths, and other preparations
for public worship they were seldom ready
for prayer at the prescribed time, but began later,
prolonged it by the movements of their bodies and
their intoning, and suddenly came to an end after
omitting several portions. They were especially
averse to the harsh interpolations in the Sabbath
and festival prayers (the Piyutim). These insertions
interrupt the most important and suggestive
portions of the service. To abolish these at a
blow, Beer Mizricz introduced the prayer-book of
the arch-Kabbalist, Isaac Lurya, which for the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_387" id="Page_387">387</a></span>
greater part conforms to the Portuguese ritual, and
does not contain poetical (poetanic) additions. In
the eyes of the ultra-orthodox this innovation was
an enormous, or rather a double crime, permitting,
as it did, the omission of interpolations hallowed by
custom, and the exchange of the German ritual for
the Sephardic.</p>

<p>This innovation would probably have been severely
visited upon the neo-Chassidim, but that at
this time, when the political power of Poland lay
crushed, the firm political connection of the Polish
Jews had also been dissolved. Poland was distracted
by civil war. "In this country," as the
Primate of Gnesen complained at the opening of the
Reichstag, March, 1764, "freedom is oppressed, the
laws are not obeyed, justice cannot be obtained,
trade is utterly ruined, districts and villages are devastated,
the treasury is empty, and the coin of the
realm has no value." It had been enfeebled by the
Jesuits, and was already regarded by Russia as a
sure prey. Its king&mdash;Stanislaus Augustus Poniatowski&mdash;was
a weakling, the plaything of internal
factions and external foes (September, 1764). In
the first year of his reign, Poniatowski among other
laws issued a regulation which destroyed the communal
union of the Polish Jews. The synod of the
Four Countries, composed of delegates, rabbis and
laymen (Parnassim), with authority to pronounce
interdicts and levy fines, was not permitted to assemble,
pass resolutions, or execute them.</p>

<p>The dissolution of the synod was very fortunate
for the neo-Chassidim. They could not be excommunicated
by the representatives of the Polish Jewish
world, but each individual congregation had to
proceed against them and forbid their meetings.
Even this step was not taken at once, as the terrible
death-struggle in which Poland engaged before
its first partition was severely felt by the wealthy
Jews, who trembled for their lives. The Confederation<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_388" id="Page_388">388</a></span>
War broke out, which made many districts a
desert; Poland was punished by eternal Justice in
the same way as it had sinned. In the name of the
pope and the Jesuits it had always persecuted dissenters,
and excluded them from public offices,
and, in the name of the dissenters, Catherine
plunged the land into fratricidal war. The Russians,
for the second time, let loose against Poland
the Zaporogian Cossacks&mdash;the savage Haidamaks&mdash;who
inflicted death, by every known method, upon
the Polish nobles, the clergy, and the Jews. The
Haidamaks hung up together a nobleman, a Jew, a
monk, and a dog, with the mocking inscription,
"All are equal." Most inhuman cruelties were inflicted
upon captives and the defenseless. In addition
came the Turks, who, in the guise of saviours
of Poland, murdered and plundered on every side.
The Ukraine, Podolia, in general the southern provinces
of Poland, were turned into deserts.</p>

<p>These misfortunes were more advantageous than
injurious to the neo-Chassidim. They spread in
the north, and whilst hitherto they had been able to
carry on their cult only in small, comparatively
young communities, from this time they gained
ground in the large and old congregations. Their
numbers had already grown to such an extent that
they formed two branches&mdash;the Mizriczians and the
Karlinians&mdash;the former called after their original
home, the latter after the village of Karlin, near
Pinsk. The Karlinians spread as far as Wilna and
Brody. At first they proceeded cautiously. As
soon as at least ten persons had assembled, they
looked for a room (St√ºbel) in which to conduct their
services; there they practiced the rites of their
creed, and sought to gain new adherents; but all
this was skillfully done, so that nothing came to
light before they had secured a firm foothold. In
Lithuania their system was not yet known, and thus
at first they aroused no suspicion.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_389" id="Page_389">389</a></span>
The first violent attack upon them was made by
a man whose influence was blessed during his lifetime,
and even after death, and who, in a more favorable
environment, might, like Mendelssohn, have
effected much for the moral advancement of his co-religionists.
Elijah Wilna (born 1720; died 1797),
whose name, with the title of "Gaon," is still mentioned
by the Lithuanian Jews with reverence and
love, was a rare exception among the mass of the
Polish Jews. He was of the purest character, and
possessed high talents, which he did not put to perverted
uses. It suffices to say of his character that
in spite of his comprehensive and profound Talmudical
erudition, he refused a post as rabbi, in
contrast to most scholars in Poland, who were
office-seekers, and obtained rabbinates by artifice.
In spite of the marvelous fertility of his pen in
many domains of Jewish literature, he allowed
nothing to be published during his lifetime, again in
contradistinction to contemporary students, who, in
order to make a name and to see their ideas in
print, scarcely waited till the ink of their compositions
was dry. In his disinterestedness, Elijah
Wilna realized the ideal of the Talmud, that a
teacher of Judaism "should use the Law neither as
a crown to adorn himself therewith, nor as a spade
to dig therewith." In spite of the superiority of his
knowledge and the full and general recognition accorded
him, he modestly and conscientiously avoided
asserting himself. The gratification that results
from research, from the seeking of knowledge, completely
satisfied him. His intellectual method corresponded
in its unaffected simplicity with his character
and life. As a matter of course, the Talmud
and all the branches connected with or dependent
on it filled his mind. But he disliked the corrupt
method of his countrymen, who indulged in hair-splitting,
casuistry, and subtleties. His sole aim
was to penetrate to the simple sense of the text;<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_390" id="Page_390">390</a></span>
he even made an attempt at the critical examination
and emendation of texts, and by his undistorted
explanations he blew down the houses of cards
which the subtle Talmudists had erected upon
quicksand.</p>

<p>It required extraordinary mental force to swim
against the high tide of custom and rise above the
aberrations into which all the sons of the Talmud in
Poland had fallen. In point of fact Elijah Wilna
stood isolated in his time. It seemed as though
from his youth he had been afraid of following the
errors of his compatriots, for he attached himself to
no special school, but, strange to say, was his own
teacher in the Talmud. Talmudical studies did not
exclusively occupy his mind. Elijah Wilna devoted
great attention to the Bible&mdash;a rarity in his circle&mdash;and,
what was still more unusual, he acquainted
himself with the grammar of the Hebrew language.
Unlike his compatriots, he by no means despised a
knowledge of extra-Talmudic subjects, but studied
mathematics, and wrote a book upon geometry,
algebra, and mathematical astronomy. He exhorted
his disciples and friends to interest themselves in
profane sciences, and openly expressed his conviction
that Judaism would be the gainer from such
studies. Only his scrupulous piety, his immaculate
conduct, his unselfishness, and his renunciation of
every office and position of honor, saved him from
the charge of heresy on account of his pursuing
extra-Talmudical branches of knowledge.</p>

<p>Elijah Wilna, above all, implanted a good spirit
in the Lithuanian Jews. He taught his sons and
disciples to seek simplicity and avoid the casuistry
of the Polish method. In Elijah Wilna the beautiful
Talmudical saying was exemplified, "He who
flees from honors is sought out by them." At an
early age he was recognized, even outside of Poland,
as an authority and a man of truth. Yet even
Elijah was subject to the delusion that the hateful<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_391" id="Page_391">391</a></span>
Kabbala was a true daughter of Judaism, and contained
true elements. He deeply lamented the
moral ruin wrought by the Kabbala among Podolian
and Galician Jews, through the rascally Frank,
who had driven them into the arms of the Church,
and made them enemies to the Synagogue; yet he
could not free himself from it. Even when the
danger of these false doctrines was brought home
to him by the rise of the Chassidim, and he was
compelled openly to oppose them, he could not
relinquish his blind fondness for the Kabbala.</p>

<p>The neo-Chassidim, or Karlinians, had crept into
Wilna, and had established a secret "St√ºbel" for
their noisy conventicles. A trusty friend of their
leader, and an emissary sent by him, had stealthily
introduced their cult into the town, and won over
several members of the Wilna community. Their
meetings, their proceedings, and their derision of
the Talmudists, were betrayed. The whole congregation
were greatly excited at this. They were
indignant that the Karlinians impudently asserted
of the respected Elijah Wilna, that, like his occupation
and his belief, his life was a lie. The elders
and rabbis forthwith took counsel. The Chassidic
conventicles were straightway attacked, investigations
set on foot, and trials instituted. Writings
were found among the Chassidim, which contained
the principle that all sadness was to be avoided,
even in the repentance for sins. But greatest uneasiness
was aroused by the alterations in the liturgy
and the disrespectful utterances against the
rabbis. Elijah Wilna, who, although he filled no
official position, was always invited to the council
meetings, and had an important voice in its decisions,
took a very serious view of the matter. He
beheld in the Chassidic aberration a continuation of
Frank's excesses and corrupting influence. The
otherwise gentle and meek man became a veritable
fanatic. The rabbis and the chiefs of the community,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_392" id="Page_392">392</a></span>
together with Elijah Wilna, addressed a letter
to all the large communities, directing them to keep
a sharp eye upon the Chassidim, and to excommunicate
them until they abandoned their erroneous
views. Several congregations immediately obeyed
this injunction. In Brody, during the fair, in the
presence of many strangers, the ban was published
against all those who prayed noisily, deviated from
the German synagogue ritual, wore white robes on
Sabbath and the festivals, and were guilty of other
strange customs and innovations. Elijah Wilna's
circle launched a vigorous denunciatory pamphlet
against the offenders. This was the first blow that
the Chassidim experienced. In addition, their
leader, Beer Mizricz, died in the same year (1772)&mdash;the
rabbis imagined in consequence of the excommunication&mdash;and
thus they felt themselves utterly
deserted. Owing to the weakness of the king, and
the greed of the neighboring nations, the kingdom
of Poland was dismembered. Through this disorganization
the union of the Chassidim was broken,
and the separated members became dependent
upon the legislature, or the arbitrary treatment, of
various governments.</p>

<p>However, this storm did not crush them; they
remained firm, and did not display the slightest
sign of submitting to their opponents (Mithnagdim).
On the contrary, the struggle made them more
active and energetic. They were not deeply
moved by the ban under which they had been
placed; this weapon, blunted since the contest for
and against Jonathan Eibesch√ºtz, could no longer
inflict wounds. The Chassidim, grown to the number
of fifty or sixty thousand, formed themselves
into small groups, each with a leader, called Rebbe.
Their itinerant preachers encouraged the individual
communities to persevere in their tenets, and to
accept persecution as a salutary trial. The connection
of the groups with one another was maintained<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_393" id="Page_393">393</a></span>
in this way; a chief from the family of Beer Mizricz
was placed at the head as the supreme Zaddik,
to whom the various Rebbe were subordinate, and
for whose use they were to set aside a portion of
their income. The possible apostasy of members
through the onslaughts from Wilna was met by the
order that the Chassidim might read no work that
had not received the approval of the Chassidic
authorities. Obedience towards their leaders had
taken so deep a root in the minds of the Chassidim
that they never transgressed this prohibition.
Their chiefs distributed among them the sermons
or collections of sayings supposed to have been
written by Israel Baalshem, or Beer Mizricz, which
emphasized the high importance of the Zaddik, of
the Chassidic life, and of scorn for the Talmudists&mdash;vile
writings, which were nevertheless read with admiration
by the members, who were kept in a constant
state of intoxication. What had hitherto been
optional and individual was raised by these writings
to the rank of statutes and stringent laws.</p>

<p>After Beer's death, two men chiefly contributed
to the exaltation of Chassidism, one through his
unbounded enthusiasm, the other by his scholarship.
These men, neither of whom is open to suspicion,
were Israel of Kozieniza (north of Radom) and
Salman of Liadi, both Beer's disciples.</p>

<p>So strong did the Chassidim again become, that
a second interdict had to be fulminated against
them. This time also the persecution originated in
Wilna, and was instigated by Elijah Wilna. The
Chassidim were declared to be heretics, with whom
no pious Jew might intermarry (summer of 1781).
Two messengers were sent from Wilna to the Lithuanian
congregations to induce them to support the
ban. In consequence of this, the collections of
Chassidic sermons and other writings, although they
contained sentences from Holy Writ, were publicly
burnt in Brody and Cracow. In Selvia, near<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_394" id="Page_394">394</a></span>
Slonim, during the fair, in the presence of large
numbers of Jews, the ban was publicly promulgated
against the Chassidim and their writings (August
21, 1781); but these obsolete methods were of little
use. In the Austrian Polish provinces (Galicia)
other means were employed by the disciples of the
Mendelssohn school against the stultifying system
of the Chassidim. The decree of Joseph II, that
schools for instruction in German and elementary
subjects be established in all Jewish communities,
encountered vigorous resistance from all Jews,
but especially from Chassidim. In the belief that
culture would improve the demoralized and barbarous
state of the people, a small body of men,
Mendelssohn's admirers, strove zealously to oppose
them. Among the most ardent workers for the
enlightenment of the Galician Jews was Alexander
Kaller. Kaller and his associates probably obtained
a decree from the court at Vienna, commanding
that no Chassidic or Kabbalistic writings
be admitted into Galicia (1785). After the second
partition of Poland, denunciations were also leveled
against the Chassidim in Russian Poland as dangerous
to the state. Salman of Liadi was dragged
in chains to St. Petersburg. Elijah Wilna is said to
have been the instigator of this charge, too; indeed,
he persecuted the sect as long as he lived. After
his death the Chassidim took vengeance upon him
by dancing upon his grave, and celebrating the day
of his decease as a holiday, with shouting and
drunkenness. All efforts made to suppress the
Chassidim were in vain, because in a measure they
represented a just principle, that of opposing the
excesses of Talmudism. Before the end of the
eighteenth century they had increased to 100,000
souls. At the present day they rule in congregations
where they were formerly persecuted, and they
are spreading on all sides.</p>

<p>The state of the German Jews, among whom the
battle against unreason began, was more satisfactory
than that of the Polish Jews. In Germany
youthful activity and energy asserted themselves,
an impulse to action that promised to repair in a
short space of time the neglect of centuries. Great
enthusiasm suddenly sprang up, which produced
wonderful, or at least surprising, results, and overcame
the benumbing effects of apathy. Young men
tore the scepter from the grasp of the aged, and
desired to preach new wisdom, or rather to rejuvenate
the old organism of Judaism with new sap.
The synagogue might well have exclaimed, "Who
hath begotten me these, seeing I have lost my
children, and am desolate, a captive, and removing
to and fro? and who hath brought up these?" A
new spirit had come upon these youths, which, in
one night, put an end to their isolation, and transformed
them into organs for historical reconstruction.
As if by agreement they suddenly closed the
ponderous folios of the Talmud, turned away from
it, and devoted themselves to the Bible, the eternal
fount of youth. Mendelssohn's Pentateuch translation
poured out a new spirit over them, furnished<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_396" id="Page_396">396</a></span>
them with a new language, and infused new poetry
into them. Whence this body of spirited young
men? What had hitherto been their course of education?
Why were they so powerfully influenced?
Suddenly they made their appearance, prophesied a
new future, without knowing exactly what they prophesied,
and, scarce fledged, soared aloft. From
Poland to Alsace, from Italy to Amsterdam, London,
and Copenhagen, new voices were heard, singing in
harmonious union. Their significance lay wholly in
their harmony; singly, the voices appear thin, piping,
and untrained; only when united do they give
forth a pleasant and impressive tone. Those who
had but recently learnt to appreciate the beauties of
Hebrew, came forward as teachers, to re-establish
in its purity a language, so greatly disfigured, so
generally used, and so continually abused. Inspired
by ideals which the sage of Berlin had conjured up,
they desired to pave the way to a thorough understanding
of Holy Writ, to acquire a taste for poetry,
and awaken zeal for science. Carried away by
ardor, they ignored the difficulties in the way of a
people, internally and externally enslaved, which
seeks to raise itself to the heights of poetry and
philosophy, and therefore they succeeded in accomplishing
the revival. On the whole they achieved
more than Mendelssohn, their admired prototype,
because the latter was too cautious to take a step
that might have an untoward result. But these
youths pressed boldly forward, for they had no
reputation to lose, and represented no interests
that could be compromised.</p>

<p>This result was produced by a material and an
ideal circumstance. Frederick's eagerness for
money, his desire to enrich the land, almost compelled
the Jews, especially those of Berlin, to accumulate
capital. Owing to their manufactories,
speculations, and enormous enterprises on the one
hand, and their moderate manner of living on the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_397" id="Page_397">397</a></span>
other, the first Jewish millionaires arose in Berlin,
and by their side many houses in affluent circumstances.
But what could be done with these riches?
To the nobility and the court, Jews were not admitted;
the Philistine burghers closed their doors
against these Jewish upstarts, whom they regarded
with envy. There thus remained for wealthy Jews
only literary intercourse, for which they have always
had a preference. All or the majority had in their
youth made the acquaintance of the Talmud, and
were intimate with the world of books. This circumstance
gave their efforts an ideal character: they
did not worship Mammon alone; reading in their
leisure hours was a necessity to them. As soon as
German literature had been naturalized in their
midst through Mendelssohn, they included it in
their circle of studies, either with the serious object
of cultivating themselves or to be in accord with
fashion. In this matter they excelled the Christian
citizens, who as a rule did not care for books.
Jewish merchants, manufacturers, and bankers interested
themselves in literary productions, as if
they belonged to a guild of learned men, using for
them the time that Christian citizens and workmen
passed in drinking.</p>

<p>The first movement was made in K√∂nigsberg, a
kind of colony to Berlin. In this town certain men
had acquired wealth by their industry and circumspection,
and shared in the culture dawning in Germany
under the influence of French literature.
Three brothers named Friedl√§nder (B√§rmann,
Meyer, and Wolf) were the leaders. To this family
belonged David Friedl√§nder (born 1750, died 1834),
a servile imitator of Mendelssohn, who by means of
his connection by marriage with the banking-house
of Daniel Itzig, obtained influence in Berlin (since
1771), and brought about close intercourse between
Berlin and K√∂nigsberg. He also took part in the
promotion of the revival among Jews. It was an<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_398" id="Page_398">398</a></span>
event in the history of the K√∂nigsberg Jews, when
Mendelssohn stayed there for several days while on
a business journey. He was visited by distinguished
persons, professors and authors, and was
treated with extraordinary attention. Immanuel
Kant, the profound thinker, publicly embraced him.
This trifling occurrence gave to the cultured Jews
of K√∂nigsberg a sort of consciousness that the Jew
can by self-respect command the regard of the ruling
classes. Moreover, the K√∂nigsberg University,
at the instigation of certain liberal-minded teachers,
especially Kant, admitted Jewish youths thirsting
for knowledge as students and academical citizens.
Among these young men, trained partly on Talmudical,
partly on academical lines, there were two
who awakened a new spirit, or rather, continued
the quiet activity of Mendelssohn with greater
effect. These were Isaac Abraham Euchel and
Mendel Bresselau, both tutors employed by the
wealthy, culture-loving Friedl√§nders. Isaac Euchel,
through Mendelssohn and Wessely, had acquired a
dignified, correct Hebrew style contrasting most
favorably with the corrupt language hitherto employed.
His younger companion, Mendel Bresselau,
who afterwards took part in the great contest
against the old school, was of more importance.
He was truly an artist in the Hebrew tongue, and
without elaboration or ambiguity he applied biblical
phraseology to modern conditions and circumstances.
He took as his model the poet Moses
Chayim Luzzatto, and like him composed a moral
drama, entitled "Youth." Supported by two young
members of the wealthy Friedl√§nder family, Euchel
and Bresselau, during the lifetime of Mendelssohn,
and at the time of Wessely's conflict with the ultra-orthodox
(spring, 1783), issued a summons to the
whole Jewish world to establish a society for the
promotion of the Hebrew language (Chebrath
Dorshe Leshon Eber), and to found a journal to be<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_399" id="Page_399">399</a></span>
called "The Gatherer" (Meassef). They had
reckoned upon the support of Wessely, already
recognized as an authority upon style, and had
asked contributions from him, who, as they expressed
themselves, "had taken down the harps
from the willows of Babylon, and had drawn forth
new songs from them." The aged poet gladly
joined the young men, but, as if he had had a foreboding
of the ultimate result, he warned them
against turning their darts against Judaism, and
in general against employing satire. Their summons
found widespread response. They had
chosen the right means to advance culture, and they
satisfied a real want. The Hebrew language in its
purity and chastity could alone accomplish the
union between Judaism and the culture of the day.</p>

<p>"The Gatherer" found most encouragement in
Berlin, the capital of Jewish culture. Here numerous
literary contributions and material support
were forthcoming. In this city lived a number of
youths moved by the same aspirations as Euchel
and Bresselau, who fostered enthusiasm for the
Hebrew language, and renewed its youth. Not too
proud to enter into rivalry with beginners, Mendelssohn
also contributed a few Hebrew poems
anonymously. It is characteristic of the newly-aroused
spirit, that the fine introductory Hebrew
verses in the periodical are represented as being
written by a young child who modestly begs admittance,
as if henceforth, not the grey-headed
Eliphaz, but the youthful Elihu was to be spokesman,
and lay down the law. Fresh names appeared
in the newly-established organ, and their
owners, under the collective name of Measfim, contributors
to "The Gatherer" (Meassef, first published
in the autumn of 1783), mark a definite
tendency, a <i>Sturm und Drang</i> period of neo-Hebraic
literature. Another pair of friends of
Euchel and Bresselau afterwards undertook the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_400" id="Page_400">400</a></span>
editorship; these were Joel L√∂we and Aaron Halle,
or Wolfssohn&mdash;the one an earnest inquirer, the
other a bold iconoclast, who first verified Wessely's
fears, and, in a dialogue between Moses Maimonides
and Moses Mendelssohn, subjected unprogressive
Judaism to scathing criticism.</p>

<p>Two Poles residing in Berlin, Isaac Satanow and
Ben-Zeeb, most accomplished masters of Hebrew
style, also belonged to the Measfim, but their studies
in German culture had an injurious effect upon
their moral character. Besides, the small number
of contributors to the "Gatherer" was swelled by
Wolf Heidenheim, a strange man, who equally abhorred
the crudeness and folly of the old system,
and the frivolity and sophistry of the new, and
banished his ill-humor by pedantically exact grammatical
and Masoretic studies on the lines of the
old masters. By his carefully arranged editions of
old writings, if he did not destroy, he at least
curbed, the old habits of slovenliness and carelessness.</p>

<p>The cultivators of Hebrew stretched out friendly
hands to each other across widely-sundered districts,
and formed a kind of brotherhood which spread to
Holland, France, and Italy. David Friedrichsfeld
was also an enthusiast for the Hebrew language
and biblical literature. He possessed such delicate
appreciation of the beauties of the language, that
an ill-chosen Hebrew word caused him pain. He
constantly insisted upon pure forms and expressions,
and was a cultivated and severe judge. In
his youth, Friedrichsfeld had chosen the better fate,
by turning his back upon Prussia, so cruel to the
Jews, and emigrating to the free city of Amsterdam.
He heartily welcomed, with youthful ardor, the plan
for the study of Hebrew, and lived to enjoy the
good fortune of celebrating in Hebrew verse the
complete emancipation of the Jews in Holland. At
his proposition, the Jewish poets in Holland joined<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_401" id="Page_401">401</a></span>
the ranks of the Measfim. The most renowned was
David Franco Mendes in Amsterdam (born 1713;
died 1792). He was descended from a Marrano
family, was a disciple of the poet Luzzatto when the
latter lived in Amsterdam, and took him as a pattern.
A series of occasional poems, in the form of
the Jud√¶o-Spanish poetry of the seventeenth century,
had gained him a name which was increased
by his Hebrew historical drama, "The Punishment
of Athalia" (Gemul Athalia). It distressed Franco
Mendes to see how the Jews turned away from
Hebrew to the fashionable French literature, because
the latter produced beautiful, artistic works,
whilst the Hebrew language seemed smitten with
sterility. This disgrace Mendes desired to blot
out, and, following in the wake of Racine and
Metastasio, he undertook to dramatize the interesting
history of the royal boy Joash who, to be protected
from murderous hands, was brought up
secretly in the Temple, and of the downfall of the
bloodthirsty queen Athalia.</p>

<p>In France the Hebrew literature of the Measfim
was represented by Moses Ensheim (Einsheim), or
Moses Metz, who for several years was private
tutor to Mendelssohn's children. He was a mathematician
of great repute, whose work has been
praised by qualified authorities of the first rank.
Thus he wrote a work upon Integral and Differential
Calculus, which won the applause of Lagrange
and Laplace. But he never published any of his
writings. He only gave voice to triumphal songs
in Hebrew upon the victory of freedom over slavery
in France, and some of these were sung in the
synagogues. Ensheim influenced an advocate
(Gr√©goire) of the liberation of his co-religionists in
France, and provided him with material wherewith
to defend them. Ensheim formed a contrast to an
older teacher in Mendelssohn's house, Herz Homberg,
a great favorite with Mendelssohn. The<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_402" id="Page_402">402</a></span>
latter was deceived in him, and trusted in him too far
when he invited his co-operation in the Pentateuch
translation. Homberg was of a prosaic nature,
actuated wholly by selfish motives, and was somewhat
of a place-hunter. Through Homberg, during
his stay in G√∂rz, and Elijah Morpurgo, who corresponded
with Mendelssohn and Wessely, the educational
influence of the Measfim penetrated to Italy;
and the younger generation, which afterwards
united with the French Jews, drew inspiration from
that source.</p>

<p>In this manner, the Hebrew language and neo-Hebraic
poetry became a bond of union for the
Jews of Western Europe, to some extent embracing
also the Jews of Poland, and led the way to an
astonishingly swift and enduring revival. The Hebrew
tongue was known to almost all Jews, with the
exception of a few ignorant villagers, and afforded
an excellent medium for propagating European culture.
Thousands of youths who studied the Talmud
in various colleges, gradually, for the greater part
secretly, took an active share in the movement, and
drank deep draughts from the stream of innovation.
Thus, with the expected deliverance from political
oppression, which had already been realized in various
places, there arose a peculiar excitement and
confusion. The old and the new mingled, forming
a kind of a spiritual hotch-potch. The question was
raised whether or not, beside the Talmud, it was
allowed to engage in biblical studies and profane
literature, to cultivate philosophy, and in general to
study the sciences (Chochmoth). The great rabbis,
Ezekiel Landau, Raphael Cohen, and others, condemned
such studies, whilst Mendelssohn and
Wessely, blamelessly pious men, not only permitted,
but even recommended them for the elevation of
Judaism. Of the old and respected authorities,
some permitted them and even occupied themselves
therewith, whilst others prohibited and held aloof<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_403" id="Page_403">403</a></span>
from them, as from some seductive sin. These important
questions presented themselves to thinking
Jewish young men, and gave rise to much disquietude.
For the greater number the charm of
novelty, the attractive language of the representatives
of the new tendency, or the inclination to cast
off burdensome ritual fetters decided the question.
The number of those interested in the periodical,
"The Gatherer," increased from year to year.
The death of Mendelssohn also exerted a decided
influence. His pupils&mdash;as such, all the Measfim
regarded themselves&mdash;deified him, glorified him
in bright colors, idealized him and his eventful
history in prose and verse, pointed him out as an
ideal worthy of imitation, and turned his renown
to advantage in their cause. They went a step
further, or widened the extent of their activity, aiming
not merely at ennobling the Hebrew language,
but at refinement in general. They called themselves
"The Society for the Good and the Noble"
(from 1787), without being able to define their purpose.
The all-powerful stream of innovation could
not be stemmed by the adherents of the old school.
Unskillfully they attempted to vindicate the old
system, exaggerating the dangers, and thereby
losing all influence.</p>

<p>Thus in almost every large community, there
arose a party of the "Enlightened" or "the Left,"
which had not yet broken with the old school, but
whose action bordered upon secession. By the
ultra-orthodox they were denounced as heretics, on
account of their preference for pure language and
form, both in Hebrew and European literature.
This abusive name hurt them but little, and rather
afforded them a certain amount of satisfaction.
The outcome of the work of the Measfim was that
they stirred men's minds, extending their range of
observation, and leading them to ennobling thoughts
and acts; but these writers did not leave any<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_404" id="Page_404">404</a></span>
permanent results. Not a single production of the
circle has enduring value. Their best performance
was Wessely's swan-song, which possesses literary,
if not artistic worth. Roused perhaps by the astonishment
of Herder, the admirer of ancient Hebrew
poetry, that no poet had celebrated the miracles of
the departure from Egypt&mdash;whose center was the
sublime prophet Moses&mdash;Wessely determined to
compose a neo-Hebraic epic. Animated by the
spirit of the prophets, there poured from his pen
smooth, well-rounded, euphonious verses, which
unroll before the eye the grand events that occurred
from the cruel bondage in Egypt till the miraculous
passage of the Red Sea and the wanderings in the
wilderness. "Songs of Glory" Wessely called his
Hebrew heroic poem, his Mosaid. In fact his verses
and strophes are beautifully arranged and perfect in
form. It is the best work that the school of the
Measfim produced. Wessely's epic was so much
admired that two Christian poets, Hufnagel and
Spalding, rendered the first two cantos into German.
The Mosaid is, however, by no means a masterpiece;
it lacks the breath of true poetry, fancy and loftiness
of conception. It is merely a history of the origin
of the Israelites transcribed into verse, or, more
correctly, a versified commentary on the Pentateuch.
This criticism holds of the school as a whole; its
disciples were good neo-Hebraic stylists, but as
poets their ability was not even mediocre.</p>

<p>The appearance of the "Gatherer" aroused
attention in Christian circles. The old assailant of the
Jews, Michaelis, could not remain silent. Others
greeted it as the dawn promising a fair day; it was
in fact daybreak for the Jewish race. What is the
distinction of a cultured people? Next to gentle
manners, it consists in taste for harmonious forms
and in the power to produce artistic creations.
This taste and power, lost through external oppression
and internal disorganization, were re-awakened<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_405" id="Page_405">405</a></span>
among the Jews by the organ of the Measfim. To
elevate the Jewish race to the rank of the cultured
nations, nothing new was required; it was merely
necessary that a comprehension of the beauties
and sublimities of their own literature be inculcated.</p>

<p>In this period, the Jews owned profound philosophical
thinkers, if not of the first, certainly of
the second rank, who in acuteness of intellect
almost surpassed Mendelssohn. Three are especially
to be mentioned, who, though trained in the
Mendelssohnian system, soon recognized its weaknesses,
and directed their minds to new paths:
these were Marcus Herz, Solomon Maimon, and
Ben-David. The events of their lives picture on a
small scale how the Jewish race as a whole worked
its way from degradation and ignorance to freedom
and enlightenment. Marcus (Mordecai) Herz (born
in Berlin, 1747, where he died 1803) was the son
of poor parents, and his father, like Mendelssohn's,
supported himself and his family by copying
Hebrew manuscripts. He received his Talmudical
education in the school founded by Ephraim Veitel.
Owing to poverty he was unable in spite of his
talents to continue his studies, but at fifteen years
of age was compelled to go to K√∂nigsberg as an
apprentice. The desire for knowledge soon withdrew
him from business and led him to the University,
as the Albertina at that time admitted Jewish
youths to the medical department. Philosophy,
however, exerted greater attraction upon him.
Herz was regarded as being gifted with the "keen
mind peculiar to the Jewish nation." Kant, then
at work upon his monumental system, saw Herz in
his audience as often as the medical professors saw
him in theirs. He distinguished him, drew him
into the circle of his intimates, and treated him as
his favorite disciple. When entering upon his
professorship, according to an absurd and antiquated
custom Kant had to argue in public upon a philosophical<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_406" id="Page_406">406</a></span>
subject, and found no one better fitted than
Herz to act as his assistant. Several University
representatives objected that a Jewish student,
however talented and superior to his Christian
companions, should be allowed equal privileges
with them. Kant, however, insisted upon his
demand. Pressed by pecuniary difficulties, and
because a Jew could not receive the degree at the
K√∂nigsberg University, Herz returned to his native
town and joined Mendelssohn's circle. He was,
however, an advocate of the Kantian philosophy.
He became at the same time a skilled physician,
and practiced his art with conscientiousness and
zeal. By his marriage with Henrietta de Lemos,
he secured a large practice and numerous acquaintances
as assistant-physician to his Portuguese
father-in-law; and through his incisive wit and
versatile knowledge he became a noted personage
in the Prussian capital. When he delivered philosophical
lectures upon the Kantian philosophy, still
new and but little understood, many distinguished
men were among his auditors. Had not progress
been great, if notabilities sat at the feet of a Jew to
hear his instruction upon the highest truths, whilst
men like Michaelis roundly denied all possibility of
culture in the Jews? Herz afterwards delivered
discourses upon physics, and illustrated the marvellous
laws of nature by experimental demonstration.
These lectures were still more crowded;
even the Crown Prince (afterwards King Frederick
William III) and other princes did not disdain to
enter the house of a Jew and be taught by him.
His philosophical lucidity, acquired from Kant and
Mendelssohn, contributed towards rendering his
lectures upon medicine, as well as upon other subjects,
enjoyable and appreciated. Herz was not,
however, an independent thinker, able to illumine
the dark ways of human knowledge by brilliant
ideas; but he succeeded in explaining the profound<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_407" id="Page_407">407</a></span>
thoughts of others and in making them intelligible
to the average mind. Through his personality and
his social position, Herz deeply influenced not alone
the culture of Berlin Jews, but also of Christian
circles.</p>

<p>Of the remarkable capacity of Jews for culture,
Solomon Maimon was a still more striking example.
This Pole, whose real name was Solomon of
Lithuania, or of Nieszwiez (born about 1753, died
1800), rose from the thickest cloud of Polish ignorance
to pure philosophical knowledge, attaining
this height by his unaided efforts, but owing to his
scepticism, he fell a prey to shocking errors. The
story of his life is full of travel and restlessness,
and is a good example of the versatility of Jews.</p>

<p>As in the case of Mendelssohn, Maimuni's philosophical
religious work, "The Guide of the Perplexed"
(More Nebuchim), was the cause of
Solomon's intellectual awakening. He read the
book until it became part of him, consequently
assumed the name of Maimon, swore by the name
of the Jewish sage whenever evil desire prompted
him to sin, and conquered by its aid. But whereas
Mendelssohn reached the right way through Maimuni,
Solomon Maimon was led into error, doubt,
and unbelief, and to the end of his life lived an
aimless existence. In despair he snatched at the
Kabbala, wishing to become a Jewish Faust, to
conjure up spirits who would obtain deep wisdom
for him; he also made a pilgrimage to the leader
of the Chassidim, Beer of Mizricz. But the deception
practiced disgusted him, and he quickly turned
away from him. But what was he, with his spirit of
scepticism, to do in a narrow world of rigid
orthodoxy? Continually play the hypocrite? Rumor
had carried a report to Poland, that in certain towns
of Germany a freer religious system prevailed, and
that more scope for philosophical inquiry was given.
At this period a Pole felt no scruples in forsaking<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_408" id="Page_408">408</a></span>
wife, children, and home, and wandering abroad.
It cost Maimon the less effort, seeing that his wife
had been thrust upon him when he was a child, and
it was to his vexation that children were born to
him. To appease his conscience he deceived himself
by the pretext that he would study medicine in
Germany, and be enabled to maintain himself and
his family.</p>

<p>Thus Maimon left Lithuania (spring, 1777), at
the age of twenty-five, "with a heavy, dirty beard,
in torn, filthy clothes, his language a jargon composed
of fragments of Hebrew, Jud√¶o-German, and
Polish, together with grammatical errors," as he
himself says, and in this guise he introduced himself
to some educated Jews in K√∂nigsberg, saying that
he desired to devote himself to science. In this
ragged Pole was a brain full of profound thoughts,
which, as he grew older, developed into maturity.
His journey from K√∂nigsberg to Berlin by way of
Stettin was a succession of pitiful troubles. In
Berlin the authorities refused to grant him residence.
Those Poles who had severed themselves from the
Talmud, and devoted themselves to science, lived
in the odor of the worst heresy, and often gave
occasion to suspicion. Maimon was sincere enough
to admit the justice of this opinion. A moral life,
activity of any kind, participation in the work of
mankind, utilization of talent in the conquest of
nature, man's liberation from the shackles of self-interest,
the awakening of his moral impulse to act
for the welfare of his brethren, the realization of the
heavenly kingdom of justice and beneficent love&mdash;of
all these ideals Maimon had no appreciation.
These were indifferent matters, with which a thinker
need not trouble himself. In this unsound state of
mind he shunned all active work; to meditate idly
and draw up formulas were his chief occupations.
He attained no fixed goal in life, but staggered
from folly to folly, from misery to misery.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_409" id="Page_409">409</a></span>
To the general public he was first known through
his "Autobiography," wherein he revealed the weak
points of the Polish Jews, to him the only representatives
of Judaism, as well as his own, with unsparing,
cynical severity, as some years previously Rousseau
had done in his "Confessions." He thereby performed
an evil service for his co-religionists. His
opinions concerning his brethren, originating in
ill-humor, were accepted to their detriment as
universal characteristics; and what he depicted as
hateful in the Polish Jews was attributed to all Jews.</p>

<p>This kind of confession was considered extraordinary,
and aroused great attention, in stiff, pedantic
Germany. The "Autobiography" found its way
into numerous circles, and gained many readers.
The two great German poets, Schiller and Goethe,
were absurdly fond of the cynical philosopher;
and Goethe expressed the wish to have him live near
him. His fame made Maimon neither better nor
happier, and he did honor to the Jewish race only
with his mental powers; in his actions he altogether
dishonored it.</p>

<p>The third Jewish thinker of this time, Lazarus
Ben-David (born in Berlin 1762; died there 1832),
had neither the tragic nor the comic history of
Maimon. He was a prosaic, pedantic personality,
who in any German university could have filled the
chair of logic and mathematics, and year after year
given the same instruction unabridged and unincreased.
For the philosophy of Kant, however,
Ben-David possessed ardor and enthusiastic devotion,
because he recognized it as the truth, and
faithfully conformed to its moral principles. This
philosophy was well suited to Jews, because it
demanded high power of thought and moral action.
For this reason Kant, like Aristotle in former days,
had many Jewish admirers and disciples. Ben-David
was also learned in the Talmud, and a good
mathematician. It was perhaps a mistake on his<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_410" id="Page_410">410</a></span>
part to go to Vienna to lecture upon the Kantian
philosophy. At first the University permitted his
discourses in its halls,&mdash;a Jew lecturing on a philosophy
which denied the right of Catholicism to
exist! He soon however had to discontinue them;
but Count Harrach offered him his palace as a
lecture-room. Meeting with obstacles here, too, he
left the imperial city, continued his discourses in
Berlin, and for some time acted as editor of a
journal. Ben-David produced but little impression
upon the course of Jewish history.</p>

<p>The German Jews, however, under Mendelssohn's
inspiration, not only elevated themselves with great
rapidity to the height of culture, but unmistakably
promoted the spread of culture in Christian circles.
Intellectual Jews and Jewesses created in Berlin
that cultured public tone which has become the distinction
of this capital, and has influenced the whole
of Germany. Jews and Jewesses were the first to
found a salon for intellectual intercourse, in which
the elements of elevated thought, taste, poetry, and
criticism mingled together in a graceful, light way,
and were discussed, and made accessible to men of
different vocations. The Christian populace of
Berlin at the time of Frederick the Great and his
successor greatly resembled that of a petty town.
The nobility and high dignitaries were too aristocratic
and uneducated to trouble themselves about
intellectual and social affairs and the outside world.
For them the court and the petty events of everyday
life were the world. The learned formed an
exclusive guild, and there was no high or wealthy
class of burghers. The middle classes followed the
narrow path of their old-fashioned German fathers;
met, if at all, over the beer-jug, and were continually
engaged in repeating stories of "old Fritz's
victories." Particularly, the women lived modestly
within their four walls, or occupied themselves
wholly with the concerns of their family circles.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_411" id="Page_411">411</a></span>
With the Jews of Berlin it was entirely different.
All, or most of them, had been more or less engaged
with the Talmud in their youth; their mental
powers were acute, and susceptible to fresh influences.
These new elements of culture Mendelssohn
gave them through his Bible translation, and
his philosophical and √¶sthetic writings. In Jewish
circles, knowledge procured more distinction than
riches; the ignorant man, however wealthy, was
held up as a butt for contempt. Every Jew, whatever
his means, prided himself on possessing a
collection of old and new books, and, when possible,
sought to know their contents, so that he might not
be wanting in conversation. Every well-informed
Jew lived in two worlds, that of business, and that
of books. In consequence of the impulse given by
Mendelssohn, the younger generation occupied itself
with <i>belles-lettres</i>, language, and philosophy.
The subjects of study had changed, but the yearning
for knowledge remained, or became still stronger.
Amongst the Jews of Berlin, shortly after the death
of Mendelssohn, were more than a hundred young
men burning with zeal for knowledge and culture,
from whose midst the contributors to the periodical
"Ha-Meassef" were supplied.</p>

<p>To this honest inclination for study, there was
added a fashionable folly. Through Frederick the
Great, French literature became acclimatized in
Prussia, and Jews were especially attracted by the
sparkling intellectuality of French wit. Voltaire
had more admirers in the tents of Jacob than in
German houses. Jewish youths ravenously flung
themselves upon French literature, and acquired its
forms; French frivolity naturally made its entry at
the same time. The clever daughters of Israel also
ardently devoted themselves to this fashionable
folly; they learned French, at first, to be sure, for
the purpose of conversing in the fashionable language
with the youthful cavaliers who borrowed<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_412" id="Page_412">412</a></span>
money from their fathers. It was one more ornament
with which to deck themselves. Through
the influence of Mendelssohn and Lessing, such
trifling gave way to earnest endeavors for the
acquisition of solid knowledge, in order that they
might occupy an equally exalted footing with the
men. Mendelssohn's daughters, who were continually
in the society of cultivated men, led the way,
and stirred up emulation. In no town of Germany
were there so many cultured Jewish women as in
Berlin, for they learned easily, were industrious,
and altogether superior to their Christian sisters in
knowledge of literature.</p>

<p>Mendelssohn's house became the center for
scientific and literary intercourse, and was the more
frequented as his friends might expect to meet distinguished
strangers there who were attracted by
his wide-spread renown, and from whom something
new might be learned. His daughters were admitted
to this witty and charming society, to which
they also introduced their young companions.
After Mendelssohn's death David Friedl√§nder and
Marcus Herz took his place. Friedl√§nder was,
however, too stiff and plain to exercise attraction.
Thus Herz's house became headquarters for Mendelssohn's
friends, who became the nucleus of a
large circle. Herz was a popular physician, and
had numerous acquaintances among distinguished
Jewish and Christian families. His lectures attracted
people of every rank to his house, and those
eager for knowledge were admitted into the intimacy
of the family circle. Herz was gifted with
caustic wit, with which he seasoned the conversation.
But more powerful than his science and his genius
was the influence of his wife. Hers was a magic
circle, into which every native or foreign personage
of importance in Berlin was magnetically drawn.
Intercourse with the beautiful and gifted Jewess
Henrietta Herz was, next to the court circle, the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_413" id="Page_413">413</a></span>
most sought after in Berlin. Had she not been
misled by seductive influences, she might have been
a source of rich blessings to Judaism.</p>

<p>This beautiful woman, then, made her house the
gathering-place of the select society of Berlin, and
illustrious strangers pressed for the honor of an introduction
to her. Here the Christian friends of
Mendelssohn, already accustomed to intercourse
with Jews, mingled freely with cultured Jews, but
also new men, who filled high positions, and diplomatists
were to be met there. Mirabeau, in whose
mind the storm-charged clouds of the Revolution
were already forming, and to whom the Jews owed
so much, during his secret diplomatic embassy
(1786) to Berlin was more in the society of Henrietta
Herz than in that of her husband. Gradually
ladies of high degree and education also entered
into relations with Madame Herz and her friends,
attracted by the charm of refined, social communion.
But her salon exercised most powerful attraction
upon cultured Christian youths, by reason of its
beautiful Jewish damsels and ladies, the satellites of
the fair hostess. These Jewish beauties, however,
did not merely form the ornament of the salon, but
took an active part in the intellectual entertainment,
and distinguished themselves by their originality.
Gentz called them "the clever women of Jewry."
Among them were two who shone by superior intellectual
qualities, and combined modern culture
with Jewish keenness of mind and wit: Mendelssohn's
eldest daughter Dorothea, and Rachel Levin,
afterwards the wife of Varnhagen von Ense. Both
possessed eminent talents, in addition to which
Rachel Levin had an inflexible love for truth, united
with gentleness and amiability.</p>

<p>Almost at the same time a brilliant salon, where
authors, artists, nobles, and diplomatists, native and
foreign, came together, was opened in Vienna,
by a Berlin Jewess, Fanny Itzig, daughter of the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_414" id="Page_414">414</a></span>
banker Daniel Itzig. She was witty, amiable and
noble, and was married to Nathan Adam von Arnstein,
who had been made a baron. Like her friends
in Berlin she brought about the social intermingling
of Jews with Christians in Vienna. These Jewish
coteries most triumphantly refuted the foolish
remark of the insolent scholar of G√∂ttingen, "that
gypsies would sooner undergo the transformation
into a people than Jews." The prejudice of a
thousand years was blown away with one breath
more effectually than by a hundred learned or eloquent
disquisitions.</p>

<p>The social equalization of the Jews in cultivated
circles of Prussia caused them to hope, if not for
complete civil rights, at least for a lightening of the
oppressive taxes and the humiliations imposed upon
them. Between the social position of cultured Jews
and their legal standing there was a deep chasm.
In the burgher classes, the Jews of Berlin were the
first millionaires&mdash;no indifferent matter considering
the important place held by money at that time&mdash;yet,
according to the law, they were treated like
peddlers. Humane treatment could not be expected
from the philosophical king. Dohm's apology
for the Jews did not exist for him. Hope was
aroused among the Berlin Jews on the accession of
Frederick William II, who was of a weak but kindly
nature. Urged on by David Friedl√§nder, who, the
successor of Mendelssohn, was at the same time
considered the representative of Jewish interests,
the chiefs and elders of the Berlin community presented
a petition for the abolition of the Jewish
poll-tax, the repeal of barbarous laws against the
Jews, and the concession of freedom of movement.
They received a favorable reply, directing them to
"choose honest men from their midst," with whom
the government might negotiate. Their proposal
to select delegates from amongst the Jews in the
provinces was assented to, and a commission was<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_415" id="Page_415">415</a></span>
established to investigate the complaints of the
Prussian Jews and make suggestions for improvement.
As general deputies of the Jews there were
selected Friedl√§nder and his rich father-in-law,
Daniel Itzig, who, with great independence and
courage, laid bare the barbarous and venal legislation
of Frederick the Great in reference to the
Jews.</p>

<p>The deputies drew up a list of the imposts extorted
from the Jews, bearing ridiculous titles; for
instance, the exportation of porcelain, which bound
them to purchase articles of the worst quality for an
exorbitant price (called in mockery "Jews' porcelain")
from the royal manufactory and to sell them
abroad; and taxes for the support of manufactories
for caps, stockings, pocket-handkerchiefs, and veils.
They pointed out burdensome restrictions, how in
courts of justice they were not treated as the equals
of Christian suitors, and they especially complained
of the responsibility laid upon all for each, and
boldly demanded complete equalization, not mere
permission to engage in agriculture and trades, but
also to fill public offices and university chairs (May,
1787). The expectations of the Jews of Berlin and
Prussia were however baffled. Only the law to
deal in bad porcelain was annulled for a sum of four
thousand thalers. The degrading body-tax was
also repealed for native Jews journeying from province
to province, and for strangers when frequenting
the fair at Frankfort-on-the-Oder (December, 1787;
July, 1788.) This release from slavery had been
effected by Joseph II and by Louis XVI of France
several years previously. The high officials therefore
advised the abolition of the Jewish poll-tax
from shame. But the gain was not great, for, as
Prussian Jews had to prove themselves such at
every public gate, the stigma was not removed. The
ultimate result of the petition of the Jewish deputies
was lamentable. What was given with one hand,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_416" id="Page_416">416</a></span>
was taken away with the other. It redounds to the
honor of the deputies that they frankly rejected the
paltry, narrow-minded concessions, remarking, "The
intended favors are below our expectation, and
hardly accord with the joyful hopes entertained at
the accession of the king." They declared that
they were not empowered to accept the reforms
offered, "which contain few advantages and many
restrictions," especially as regarded the enlistment
of common soldiers. Only certain individual Jews
received exceptional equalization of rights. Orders
were given that in official acts they should not be
treated as Jews. Otherwise everything continued
as of old, only slight relief being given to the Jews
in Silesia.</p>

<p>Thus a nucleus for the elevation of the Jewish
race was formed in the Berlin community, and their
efforts were encouraged, if not by the state, at least
by public opinion. In two ways their action influenced
a wider circle&mdash;through the Free School
(Chinuch Nearim), and the printing establishment
connected with it. The Free School, conducted by
David Friedl√§nder and his brother-in-law, Itzig
Daniel Itzig, was not managed according to
Wessely's ideal plan. The curriculum was composed
mainly of the subjects of a general education,
and gradually everything Jewish (Hebrew, the
Bible, the Talmud) was crowded out. In ten years
(1781&ndash;1791) over five hundred well-taught pupils
were graduated from the school&mdash;apostles of the
Berlin spirit, who spread its influence in all directions.
It became a model school for German and
other communities. With similar ends in view the
printing-press sent into the Ghettos a large number
of instructive works in Hebrew and German. The
spirit engendered thereby was at first one of scepticism,
of superficial enlightenment. Its aim was to
eradicate from Jewish life and manners everything
that offended cultured taste or made the Jews<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_417" id="Page_417">417</a></span>
objects of derision, but it included in its attack whatever
did not at once recommend itself to the sober-minded,
and so tended to obliterate everything that
recalled the great events of the past, and that
caused the Jews to appear as a separate race in the
eyes of Christians. The dearest ambition of the
advocates of this movement was to resemble Christians
in every respect. "Enlightenment, Culture"
were their passwords, the idols of their worship, to
which they sacrificed everything. Mendelssohn had
left no disciple of any importance able to recognize
the great truths of Judaism, and bring them into
accord with culture. Men like Euchel, L√∂we, Friedl√§nder,
Herz, and almost all the Measfim, possessed
mediocre minds and limited views; they were unable
to scatter abroad fruit-bearing germs of thought.
Despite their enthusiasm for Mendelssohn, they did
not appreciate the essence of his nature, and thought
that he was still in their midst, when they had long
forsaken him. Even his own children, not excepting
his accomplished daughters, misunderstood him;
and this misconception resulted in great confusion.</p>

<p>With every step forward taken by the Berlin
school of enlightenment, it became more opposed
to the main body of Judaism, vexing its susceptibilities,
and thereby frustrating its own efficacy.
Misunderstandings, bitter feelings, friction, and
strife were the direct consequences.</p>

<p>The ultra-orthodox party, however, numbered
still fewer men of importance than the advanced
school. The most eminent leader among them, or
the one regarded as such, Ezekiel Landau, in
Prague, had not the slightest sympathy with the
new tendency, but thoughtlessly clung to every
usage however unjustifiable, and thereby injured
the cause he represented. He had only condemnation
and denunciation as heretics for those who
withdrew from the well-trodden path.</p>

<p>Owing to the friction between the progressive<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_418" id="Page_418">418</a></span>
and the orthodox parties, both of whom exceeded
all proper bounds, an exciting quarrel sprang up in
the Berlin community. Young men&mdash;private tutors,
merchants' apprentices, the sons of the rich, and
fashionable youths&mdash;boasted a frivolous philosophy,
and proudly despised their hoary religion, considering
everything that interfered with their pleasures
as superstition, prejudice, and Rabbinical folly.
The adherents of the old views therefore grew the
more tenacious, and held to everything that bore a
religious stamp. As the orthodox communal leaders
still had the upper hand in the benevolent institutions,
they refused support to the partisans of
enlightenment, especially to strangers, would not
admit their sick into the Jewish hospital, and denied
the dead honorable burial. In short all the phenomena
that usually accompany religious party
conflicts appeared. Those without families, among
whom were two prominent Measfim, Euchel and
Wolfssohn, determined to unite together so as not
to stand isolated against the orthodox party. They
desired to form a union for the protection of its
members. Mendelssohn's eldest son, Joseph, was
very zealous in promoting such a union, and on the
strength of his name it met with abundant encouragement.
Thus the "Society of Friends" was
formed (1792), a community of <i>illuminati</i> within
the community, comprising solely unmarried men,
whose chief aim was to regard each other as
brothers, and to support each other in distress and
illness; but their collateral intention was to spread
culture and promote enlightenment. The "Friends"
took a saying of Mendelssohn as their motto, "To
seek for truth, to love the beautiful, to desire the
good, to do the best." A bundle of staves was
their symbol. In the first year of its existence, the
union numbered more than a hundred members in
the capital. Young men in K√∂nigsberg, Breslau,
and Vienna, joined the ranks. A bond of cordial<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_419" id="Page_419">419</a></span>
brotherhood held the members together, and to the
present day, a fraternal feeling of delicate benevolence
has survived in the Society. But it was a
morbid symptom. The Society floated in the air
without a firm basis; it had roots neither in its own
midst, nor in Judaism, nor did it attach itself to any
great political ideal. It aimed at bodily welfare
and quietude, as if civilized men could live by
bread only: the catchwords and phrases of culture
and enlightenment did not avail much. The struggle
against the old r√©gime was but weak; all that
they succeeded in doing was to keep their deceased
friends longer above ground. In short, the
"Society of Friends" lacked the leaven of inspiration,
the only quality which ultimately bears fruit.</p>

<p>If the members of this Society took up no firm
attitude, those who never knew an ideal, nor even
a dreamy striving, the commonplace men who were
mere slaves, and sought their whole happiness in
mixing with Christians, acted yet more culpably.
The old system had no charms for them, and the
new one no tangible form to attract them. The
example of the court and high circles of society
exercised an evil influence also upon the Jews of
the large towns of Prussia. "Under Frederick
William II," as Mirabeau remarks from his own
observation, "Prussia had fallen into a condition of
rottenness, before having attained the stage of
maturity." Jewish youths of wealthy houses followed
the general inclination to sensual pleasures. Not
secretly, but openly in the light of day, they over-leapt
all bounds, and with contempt of Judaism
united contempt for chastity and morality. They
aped other apes. Earnest men, such as David
Friedl√§nder, Lazarus Ben-David, and Saul Asher,
deplored the decay of morality among the Jews,
without noticing that their own shallow desire for
enlightenment had contributed to it.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_420" id="Page_420">420</a></span></p>

<blockquote>

<p>"Vices have spread in our midst, which our fathers knew not, and
which at any price have been bought too dearly. Irreligion, voluptuousness,
and effeminacy, weeds that spring from the misuse of
enlightenment and culture, have alas! taken root amongst us, and
especially in the principal towns we are exposed to the danger that
the stream of luxury along with our boorishness is sweeping away our
severe and simple morals."</p></blockquote>

<p>Having broken loose from the bond of a national
religion existing for thousands of years, superficial
reasoners and profligates passed over to Christianity
in a body. "They were like moths, fluttering
around the flame, till they were consumed." Of
what use was it to be galled by the fetters of the
"general privilege," of what use to continue to bear
the disgrace of being "protected" Jews, if by the
repetition of an empty formula they could become
equal to the Christians! So they washed away the
mark of the yoke and its shame with the waters of
baptism. The congregations of Berlin, Breslau,
and K√∂nigsberg beheld daily the apostasy of their
members, of the richest and outwardly the most
cultured people. It appeared as if the words of the
prophet would be verified, "I will leave in the
midst of thee an afflicted and poor people." It
must be considered a miracle that the entire Jewish
party of enlightenment in Germany did not abjure
Judaism. Three invisible powers kept them from
following <i>en masse</i> the example of treachery and
apostasy: deep aversion to the dogma of Divine Incarnation,
indestructible attachment to their families
and to their great past of thousands of years, and
love for the Hebrew language and literature.
Without suspecting it, they felt themselves united
as a nation, a link in the long chain of the history
of the Jewish race, and they could not persuade
themselves to separate from it. The revival of
Hebrew through the Measfim had had beneficial
influence in this direction. Whoever could comprehend
the beauties and elevated thoughts of biblical
literature, and could imitate the language, remained<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_421" id="Page_421">421</a></span>
a Jew in spite of secret doubts, degradation,
and disgrace. Thus Mendelssohn provided the
new generation both with a poison and its antidote.</p>

<p>David Friedl√§nder alone proved an exception to
this rule. Neither Jewish antiquity, nor Hebrew
poetry, nor family ties, had power to keep him loyal
to his banner, even with half-hearted devotion.
The tearing asunder of all family connections, the
casting aside of the duties of the religious brotherhood,
did indeed oppress him. Nevertheless, he
proceeded to sever himself from the Jewish community
and to desert to the hostile camp. He
had striven to obtain for himself and his whole
family an exceptional naturalization with all its
rights and duties, but had not succeeded. This
pained him, and instead of hiding his annoyance in
the pride of ancestry and martyrdom, instead of
working on behalf of his co-religionists so as to surpass
the haughty Christians, he coveted the honor
of joining them. Friedl√§nder, however, did not desire
to effect this desertion alone or absolutely.
He therefore, together with other fathers of families
similarly disposed, in a cowardly manner directed a
letter, without mentioning either himself or others
by name, to the chief consistorial councilor Teller,
who was on friendly terms with Jews. This letter
expressed their desire for conversion and baptism,
under the condition that they might be excused
from believing in Jesus, and from participating in
the rites of the church, or that at least they might
be allowed to explain Christian dogmas in their own
manner&mdash;a suggestion equally silly and dishonorable.
Friedl√§nder could not deny that, among the
Jews, "virtue was general, benevolence inherent,
parental and filial love, and the sanctity of marriage
deeply rooted, self-sacrifice for the sake of others
frequent; and that, on the other hand, gross
crimes&mdash;murder, robbery, and outrage&mdash;were rare."
But this bright side of their servile state seemed to<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_422" id="Page_422">422</a></span>
him only a secondary matter. Therefore, in this
foolish letter, he libeled his people and its past,
called the Talmud (that mental tonic) mysticism,
spoke in illogical confusion now of the harmful
character, now of the utility of the ritual laws of
Judaism, and sketched the development of Jewish
history in a way not to be excelled for perversity.</p>

<p>Teller disposed of the Jewish fathers who craved
a Christianity without Jesus politely, but decisively,
as they deserved. They might remain what they
were, for Christianity had no desire for such infidel
believers. Friedl√§nder had met with an ignominious
experience; he remained a Jew, but his children
pressed forward to be baptized without conditions
or qualifications. His letter however
aroused more attention than it deserved.</p>

<p>If the German Jews, especially those of Berlin,
through their intercourse with Christian society, and
their interest in literature, gained in external conduct,
in forms of politeness, and social manners&mdash;advantages
not to be underrated&mdash;they lost something
for which there was no compensation. The
chastity of Jewish women and maidens during their
isolation had been of inviolable sanctity; the happiness
of family life rested upon this precious basis.
Jewish women were seldom married for love&mdash;the
Ghetto was not the place for the dallyings of love&mdash;but
after marriage duty induced love. This sanctuary,
the pride of Israel, which filled earnest
Christians with admiration, and led them highly to
esteem the Jews, became dishonored by their association
with Christians of the corrupt higher ranks.</p>

<p>If the enemies of the Jews had designed to break
the power of Israel, they could have discovered no
more effectual means than infecting Jewish women
with moral depravity, a plan more efficacious than
that employed by the Midianites, who weakened
the men by immorality. The salon of the beautiful
Henrietta Herz became a sort of Midianite tent.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_423" id="Page_423">423</a></span>
Here a number of young Jewish women assembled,
whose husbands were kept away by their business.
The most prominent male member of this circle
was Frederick von Gentz, the embodiment of selfishness,
licentiousness, vice, and depravity, whose
chief occupation was the betrayal of women.
Henrietta Herz was the first to be confused and led
astray by homage to her beauty. It was the time
when German romanticism, the product of Goethe's
muse, began to act upon the minds of men, urging
them to translate lyrical emotions into reality, and
transfigure life poetically. This romantic tendency
resulted in fostering sentimentality and in infamous
marriages which were contracted and dissolved at
pleasure. A so-called Band of Virtue (Tugend-Bund)
was formed, of which Henrietta Herz, two
daughters of Mendelssohn, and other Jewesses, together
with Christian profligates, were members.
The Jewish women felt themselves exalted and
honored by their close intimacy with Christians of
rank; they did not see the fanged serpent beneath
the flowers. With William von Humboldt, an ardent
youth, afterwards a Prussian minister, Henrietta
secretly maintained an amatory correspondence
behind her husband's back.</p>

<p>When William von Humboldt married, and
forgot Henrietta, who had been misled by her vanity,
she entered into an ambiguous relation with
Schleiermacher, the modern apostle of the new
Christianity. Their conspicuous intimacy was
mocked at by acquaintances, even more than by
strangers. Both parties denied somewhat too
anxiously the criminality of their intimate intercourse.
Whether true or not, it was disgrace
enough that evil tongues should even suspect the
honor of a Jewish matron of good family.</p>

<p>Schleiermacher's companion was Frederick Schlegel,
who stormed heaven with childish strength,&mdash;a
chameleon in sentiments and views, enthusiastic<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_424" id="Page_424">424</a></span>
now for the republic, now for monarchical despotism,
who conjured up the specters and evil spirits of the
Middle Ages. Introduced into the salon of Herz,
he became the bosom friend of Schleiermacher, and
at once resolved to seduce Dorothea Mendelssohn.
Her father had died with the knowledge that she
was joined in happy wedlock to the banker Simon
Veit Witzenhausen. Her husband surrounded her
with marks of attention and love. Two children
were the issue of this marriage. Nevertheless,
she allowed herself to be led into faithlessness by
the treacherous voice of the romantic Schlegel.
It was the fashion in this society to complain about
being misunderstood and the discord of souls.
The immoral teachings of Goethe's elective affinities
had already taken root in Jewish families. The
thought of parting from her husband and children
did not restrain Dorothea from going astray, and
Henrietta Herz acted as go-between. Dorothea
therefore left her husband, and lived with Schlegel,
at first in unlawful union. All the world was
astounded at this immorality, which dragged Mendelssohn's
honorable name in the mud. Doctor
Herz forbade his wife to hold intercourse with this
depraved woman. But she herself was at heart
an adulteress, and informed her husband that she
would not forsake her friend. Schleiermacher, the
preacher, also took but little offense at this dissolute
conduct. Dorothea followed her romantic betrayer
from one folly to another, was baptized as a
Protestant, and finally, together with him, became
converted to Catholicism. It was a lamentable
sight when Mendelssohn's daughter kissed the
toe of the pope. The younger sister, Henrietta
Mendelssohn, was not handsome enough to enthrall
the libertines of the salon. It suffices to indicate
her bent of mind to say that she also went over to
Catholicism. The consequence of this internal
corruption was to render the participators out of
sorts with life.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_425" id="Page_425">425</a></span>
Rachel Levin, another high-spirited woman, was
too clever to take part in the frivolity of the Band
of Virtue. She desired to pursue her own way.
But her wisdom and clear mind did not secure her
against the contamination of immorality. In one
respect she was superior to her sinful Jewish sisters;
she was truthful, and wore no mask. When Rachel
first made the acquaintance of the heroic but dissolute
Prince Louis Ferdinand, she undertook to teach
him "garret-truths"; but she rather learned from
him the follies of the palace. Herself unmarried,
she consented to become the intermediary between
him and the abandoned Pauline Wiesel. Rachel
Levin, or, as she was also called, Rachel Robert, in
whose veins flowed Talmudic blood, which endowed
her with a bright and active mind, and enabled her
to penetrate to the very foundation of things, and
pursue the soul and its varying instincts in their
subtlest manifestations, ignored her own origin.
She desired to distinguish the breath of God in the
mutations of history, yet had no appreciation of
the greatness of her race. She despised it, considering
it the greatest shame and her worst misfortune
to have been born a Jewess. Only in the hour of
death did a faint suspicion of the great importance
of Judaism and the Jews cross her mind.</p>

<blockquote>

<p>"With exalted delight I meditate upon my origin and the web of
history, through which the oldest reminiscences of the human race
are united with present affairs, despite distance of time and space.
I, a fugitive from Egypt, am here, and find assistance. What all my
life I considered my greatest disgrace, I now would not give up for
any price."</p></blockquote>

<p>But even in that hour her mind did not see clearly,
her thoughts were disordered, and she exhausted
herself in fantastic dreams.</p>

<p>These talented but sinful Jewish women did
Judaism a service by becoming Christians. Mendelssohn's
daughters and Rachel were converted
publicly, while Henrietta Herz, who had more regard<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_426" id="Page_426">426</a></span>
for appearances, received baptism in a small town
to avoid hurting her Jewish friends, and took this
step only after her mother's death.</p>

<p>Schleiermacher again inoculated the cultivated
classes in Germany with a peculiar, scarcely definable,
antipathy to Judaism. He was in no way a
Jew-baiter, in the usual sense of the term, and
indignantly protested against being called so; but
his mind was agitated with a vague, disagreeable
feeling towards the Jews, from which he could not
escape. When Friedl√§nder's foolish letter on the
admission of certain families into Christianity
divested of the dogma of the Trinity, was published,
Schleiermacher expressed himself adverse to their
admission. The state might concede to the Jews
the rights of citizenship, but should tolerate them
only as a special sect, inasmuch as they would not
surrender their hope in the Messiah. It was quite
in accordance with his romantic neo-Christianity,
that from ignorance and confusion he depicted
Judaism as a mummy "around which its sons sit
moaning and weeping." He would not even
acknowledge Judaism as the forerunner of Christianity.
"I detest this sort of historical relationship
in religion." Hitherto, Christendom had been conscious
of a certain connection with Judaism, and the
Old Testament, the Bible, had been the common
ground upon which the insolent daughter and the
enslaved mother met, and for the moment forgot
their hatred. To this connection, or its recognition,
the Jews owed their salvation in the sad days of
excess of Christian faith, or they would have been
altogether annihilated in Europe. The papacy protected
them, "because the Saviour had come from
their midst." This bond Schleiermacher destroyed
at a breath. To have anything in common with the
Jews enraged him. But were not Jesus, the Apostles,
and the early Fathers of the Church, Jews?
Schleiermacher would willingly have denied this<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_427" id="Page_427">427</a></span>
fact, if he could possibly have done it; but as this
was impracticable, he enshrouded it in mystery.</p>

<blockquote>

<p>"What? we are to believe that Jesus was only a Jewish Rabbi,
with philanthropic sentiments, and some Socratic morality; with
certain miracles, or at least what some consider as such, and with
the talent of composing neat riddles and parables&mdash;some follies will
even then have to be forgiven him, according to the first three
Evangelists; and such a man could have established a new religion
and a Church&mdash;a man who cannot be compared with Moses and
Mahomet?"</p></blockquote>

<p>This fact Schleiermacher could not tolerate; for
in such case, not only Moses the prophet, but also
Moses Mendelssohn, the sage of Berlin, would have
been greater. Therefore Schleiermacher removed
his Jesus far away from Judaism; he had only had
the accident of birth in common with the Jews, but he
was superhuman, and still a man, "whose consciousness
of God may properly be called existence of God
within him," as it is expressed in this mystic, extravagant,
romantic teaching, which thus took its own
chief under its protection. Schleiermacher's sermons
were filled with this kind of word-juggling, to
which the Berlin Jews, especially the women, listened
as devoutly as their ancestors to the lying
tricks of the false prophets. The school of Schleiermacher,
which became the leading influence in
Germany, made this intense contempt of Judaism
its password and the basis of its orthodoxy.</p>

<p>At the same time, another romanticist, Chateaubriand,
invented new, flimsy supports for Christianity,
which was in ruins and almost forgotten in France.
Even though he traced the origin of the arts, music,
painting, architecture, eloquence, and poetry, to
Christianity, he, at least, did not deny a share in
these merits to Judaism, though only with the intention
of claiming for Christianity the noblest features
in Hebrew literature and history. "There are only
two bright names and memories in history, those of
the Israelites and the Pelasgians (Greeks)." When
Chateaubriand desired to prove his assertion that<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_428" id="Page_428">428</a></span>
the poetry of nature is the invention of Christianity,
he cited as examples the beautiful descriptions in
Job, in the Prophets, and the Psalms, to whose
poetry the works of Pindar and Horace were much
inferior. Chateaubriand gathered the flowers of
Hebrew poetry to weave a beautiful garland for his
crucified god. But he did not, like Schleiermacher,
crush Judaism into the dust by denying the paternity
of the child grown to be so powerful.</p>

<p>A new Jud√¶ophobia sprang from the neo-Christian
school, which, as its originators obtained political
influence, grew much stronger than that of old
orthodox Christianity. It is remarkable that the twofold
reaction, that of the Church, brought about by
Schleiermacher, and that of the political world,
which is connected with Gentz, had its rise in the
Jud√¶o-Christian salon in Berlin. But in the same
year when the effeminate Schleiermacher, in his
romantic delineation of himself, calumniated Judaism
by describing it as a mummy, there arose a man, a
hero, a giant in comparison with these wretched
dwarfs, who issued a summons for the Jews to
gather round his standard. He wished to conquer
the Holy Land of their fathers for them, and, a
second Cyrus, to rebuild their Temple. The freedom
which the Berlin Jews desired to attain by
the surrender of their peculiarities, and by humiliation
before the Church, they now obtained through
France, without paying this price and without disgraceful
bargaining.</p>

<p>He who believes that Providence manifests itself in
history, that sins, crimes, and follies on the whole
serve to elevate mankind, finds in the French Revolution
complete confirmation of this faith. Could
this eventful reaction, which the whole of the civilized
world gradually experienced, have happened
without the long chain of revolting crimes and
abominations which the nobility, the monarchy, and
the Church committed? The unnatural servitude
inflicted by the temporal and spiritual powers produced
liberty, but nourished it with poison, so that
liberty bit into its own flesh, and wounded itself.
The Revolution was a judgment which in one day
atoned for the sins of a thousand years, and which
hurled into the dust all who, at the expense of justice
and religion, had created new grades of society.
A new day of the Lord had come "to humiliate all
the proud and high, and to raise up the lowly."
For the Jews, too, the most abject and despised
people in European society, the day of redemption
and liberty was to dawn after their long slavery<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_430" id="Page_430">430</a></span>
among the nations of Europe. It is noteworthy
that England and France, the two European countries
which first expelled the Jews, were the first to
reinstate them in the rights of humanity. What
Mendelssohn had thought possible at some distant
time, and what had been the devout wish of Dohm
and Diez, those defenders of the Jews, was realized
in France with almost magical rapidity.</p>

<p>However, the freedom of the French Jews did
not fall into their laps like ripe fruit, in the maturing
of which they had taken no trouble. They
made vigorous exertions to remove the oppressive
yoke from their shoulders; but in France the result
of their activity was more favorable and speedy
than in Germany. The most zealous energy in
behalf of the liberation of the French Jews was displayed
by a man, whose forgotten memory deserves
to be transmitted to posterity. Herz Medelsheim
or Cerf Berr (born about 1730, died 1793) was the
first to exert himself by word and deed to remove
the prejudices against his co-religionists, under
which he himself suffered severely. He was
acquainted with the Talmud, in good circumstances,
warm-hearted enough to avoid the selfishness bred
by prosperity, and sufficiently liberal to understand
and spread the new spirit emanating from Mendelssohn.
He was intimately acquainted with the
Berlin sage, and undertook to disseminate the Pentateuch
translation in Alsace. Owing to his position,
Cerf Berr was enabled to work for the emancipation
of his brethren. He furnished the French
army with the necessaries of war, and therefore had
to be in Strasburg, where no Jew was allowed to
live. At first he was allowed in Strasburg only one
winter, but having performed great services to the
state, during the war and a famine under Louis
XV, the permission to stay was repeatedly prolonged
by the minister, and he utilized this favor to
take up his permanent residence there. Cerf Berr<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_431" id="Page_431">431</a></span>
drew other Jews to Strasburg. Secretly he purchased
houses for himself and his family, and owing
to his services to the state, he obtained from Louis
XVI all the rights and liberties of royal subjects,
especially the exceptional privilege of possessing
landed property and goods. He also established
factories in Strasburg, and tried to have the work
done by Jews, so as to withdraw them from petty
trading and deprive their accusers of all excuse for
their prejudices.</p>

<p>Although Cerf Berr was a useful member of
society, and brought profit to the town, the Germans
in Strasburg viewed the settlement of Jews within
their walls askance, and made every conceivable
effort to expel Berr and his friends. This Philistine
narrow-mindedness on the one hand, and Dohm's
advocacy of the Jews on the other, as well as the
partial relief afforded by Emperor Joseph, impelled
Berr seriously to consider the emancipation of the
Jews, or at least their admission to most of the
French towns, and to endeavor to carry the measure
at court. To win public opinion, he energetically
spread Dohm's Apology in France. The proposals
of Cerf Berr were favorably received at court.
From other quarters, also, the French government
was petitioned to lighten the oppressive measures,
which weighed especially on the Jews of Alsace and
Lorraine. The good-natured Louis XVI was inclined
to remove any abuse as soon as it was placed
before him in its true light. The noble Malesherbes,
enthusiastic for the well-being of mankind, probably
at the instigation of the king, summoned a commission
of Jews, which was to make suggestions for
the amelioration of the condition of their brethren in
France. As a matter of course, Cerf Berr was
invited. As representative of the Jews of Lorraine,
his ally, Berr Isaac Berr of Nancy, was summoned,
who afterwards developed the greatest zeal for the
emancipation of his co-religionists. Portuguese<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_432" id="Page_432">432</a></span>
Jews from Bordeaux and Bayonne, the two towns
where they resided, were also included in the commission.
Furtado, who subsequently played a part
in the history of the Revolution, Gradis, Isaac
Rodrigues of Bordeaux, and Lopes-Dubec, were
members of this commission instituted by Malesherbes.
These eminent men, all of them animated
with zealous sympathy for their languishing brethren,
undoubtedly insisted upon the repeal of exceptional
laws, but their proposals are not known. Probably
in consequence of their efforts, Louis XVI abrogated
the poll-tax, which had been particularly degrading
to the Jews in the German-speaking provinces of
France.</p>

<p>More effectually than Cerf Berr and the Jewish
commission, two men worked for the liberation of
the Jews who in a measure had been inspired by
Mendelssohn and his friends, and were the incarnation
of the Revolution. They were Mirabeau and
the Abb√© Gr√©goire, no less zealous for liberty than
the former. Count Mirabeau (born 1749; died 1791),
who was always on the side of the oppressed
against the oppressors, was first induced, by his
intimacy with Mendelssohn's circle, to raise his voice
of thunder on behalf of the Jews.</p>

<p>Filled with admiration for the grand personality
of Mendelssohn, and inspired by the thought of
accomplishing the deliverance of an enslaved race,
Mirabeau wrote his important work "Upon Mendelssohn
and the Political Reform of the Jews"
(1787). Of the former he drew a brilliant picture.
The Jewish sage could not have wished for a warmer,
more inspired, more clear-sighted interpreter. The
liking he entertained for Mendelssohn Mirabeau
transferred to the Jews in general.</p>

<blockquote>

<p>"May it not be said that his example, especially the outcome of
his exertions for the elevation of his brethren, silences those who,
with ignoble bitterness, insist that the Jews are so contemptible that
they cannot be transformed into a respectable people?"</p></blockquote>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_433" id="Page_433">433</a></span>
This observation was the introduction to Mirabeau's
vindication of the Jews, in which he gave a
correct exposition of what Dohm had adduced and
what he himself had experienced. He surveyed the
long, tragic history of the Jews, discovering traits
very different from those found by Voltaire. Mirabeau
saw the glorious martyrdom of the Jews and
the disgrace of their oppressors. Their virtues he
extolled freely, and attributed their failings to the
ill-treatment they had received.</p>

<blockquote>

<p>"If you wish the Jews to become better men and useful citizens,
then banish every humiliating distinction, open to them every avenue
of gaining a livelihood; instead of forbidding them agriculture,
handicrafts, and the mechanical arts, encourage them to devote
themselves to these occupations."</p></blockquote>

<p>With telling wit, Mirabeau refuted the arguments
of the German anti-Semites, Michaelis and the G√∂ttingen
guild of scholars, against the naturalization
of the Jews. It was only necessary to place the
different objections side by side to demonstrate
their absurdity. On the one hand, it was maintained
that, in their rivalry with Christians, the Jews
would gain the upper hand, and from another point
of view it was demonstrated that they would always
remain inferior. "Let their opponents first agree
among themselves," he remarked, "at present they
refute each other." Mirabeau foresaw, with prophetic
clearness, that in a free and happy condition
the Jews would soon forget their Messianic king,
and that therefore the justification of their permanent
exclusion, derived from their belief in the Messiah,
was futile.</p>

<blockquote>

<p>"There is only one thing to be lamented, that so highly gifted a
nation should so long have been kept in a state wherein it was impossible
for its powers to develop, and every far-sighted man must
rejoice in the acquisition of useful fellow-citizens from among the
Jews."</p></blockquote>

<p>On all occasions Mirabeau seized the opportunity
of speaking warmly on behalf of the Jews. He was<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_434" id="Page_434">434</a></span>
devoted to them and their biblical literature, and
scattered the clouds of prejudice with which Voltaire
had enveloped them. When Mirabeau undertook
the defense of any matter, the victory was
already half won. His suggestions for reform
came at the right moment.</p>

<p>Among the thousand matters that occupied public
opinion on the eve of the Revolution was also
the Jewish question. The Jews, especially in Alsace,
complained of their unendurable misery, and
the Christian populace, of their intolerable impoverishment
through the Jews. In Metz an anti-Jewish
pamphlet had appeared, entitled "The
Citizen's Cry against the Jews," which inflamed the
worst passions of the people against them. The
pamphlet was indeed prohibited; but what slanderous
assertion, however incredible, has ever been
without result? Appearances, in point of fact, were
against the Jews. A young Jewish author, the first
Alsatian Jew who wrote in French, published a
stinging reply (1787), which justified the expectation
that the Jews would no longer, as in Voltaire's time,
permit such insults to pass unnoticed, but would
emerge from their attitude of silent suffering.
Isaiah Berr Bing (born 1759; died 1805), well-educated
and eloquent, better acquainted with the
history of his people than his Jewish contemporaries,
including even the Berlin leaders, rebutted every
charge with convincing emphasis.</p>

<p>Through these writings for and against the Jews,
the Jewish question became prominent in France.
The Royal Society of Science and Arts in Metz
offered a prize for the best essay in answer to the
question, "Are there means to make the Jews
happier and more useful in France?" Three replies,
all in favor of the Jews, were sent in&mdash;by
two Christian inquirers, and one Jewish, the Abb√©
Gr√©goire, Thiery, the member of Parliament for
Nancy, and Salkind Hurwitz the Pole, of Kovno<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_435" id="Page_435">435</a></span>
(on the Niemen), who had emigrated to Paris.
That of Gr√©goire, however, had the greatest effect.
Gr√©goire was a simple nature, and in the midst of
universal corruption had preserved a pure, childlike mind.</p>

<p>When these apologetic pamphlets appeared, the
storm-charged clouds of the Revolution, which were
to bring about destruction and reorganization in the
world, had already gathered. The fetters of a
double slavery, beneath which European nations
groaned, that of the State and the Church, were at
length, in one country at least, to be broken. As
if touched by a magic wand, France turned into a
glowing furnace, where all the instruments of serfdom
were consumed, and out of the ashes arose
the French nation, rejuvenated, destined for great
things, the first apostle of the religion of freedom,
which it loved with passionate devotion. Was it
not natural to expect the hour to strike for the
redemption of the most abased people, the Jews?
Two of their most ardent defenders sat in that part
of the National Assembly which, truly representative
of the nation, restored inalienable rights to
those so long disinherited by Church and State.
These representatives were Mirabeau, one of the
fathers of the Revolution, and the Abb√© Gr√©goire,
who owed his election to his essay in defense of
the Jews.</p>

<p>At the outbreak of the Revolution, there lived in
France scarcely 50,000 Jews&mdash;almost half of whom
(20,000) dwelt in Alsace&mdash;under the most oppressive
yoke. In Metz, the largest, "the pattern community,"
only 420 Jewish families were tolerated,
and in the whole of Lorraine only 180, and these
were not allowed to increase. In Paris, in spite of
stringent prohibitions, a congregation of about 500
persons had gathered (since 1740); about as many
lived in Bordeaux, the majority of them of new-Christian
or Portuguese descent. There were also<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_436" id="Page_436">436</a></span>
some communities in the papal districts of Avignon
and Carpentras. In Carpentras there dwelt about
700 families (over 2,000 souls) with their own rabbinate.
Those in the best condition were the Jews
of Bordeaux and the daughter community of Bayonne.
Among the Jews of the various provinces
there was as little connection as among those in
other European countries. Misfortune had separated
them. Thus it happened that no concerted
action was taken to obtain naturalization from the
National Assembly at once, although Gr√©goire, the
Catholic priest, true love for mankind in his heart,
exhorted them to seize this favorable opportunity.
They indeed boasted men of energy, filled with love
for their race, and ready for self-sacrifice, men of
tact, such as Cerf Berr, Furtado, Isaac Berr, and
David Gradis, but at first no measures were taken.
An appeal for united action may possibly have been
made, but the pride of the Portuguese probably
made it ineffectual. Therefore, in the first stormy
months of the Revolution, nothing was undertaken
for the emancipation of the Jews. The deputies in
the States General or the National Assembly were
sufficiently occupied without thinking of the Jews.
Besides, they adhered rather closely to the programme
enumerating the wishes of their electors,
on which the emancipation of the Jews was not
mentioned. The deputies of Alsace and Lorraine,
in fact, had received instructions to attack the Jews.
The assaults made upon the Jews in the German
provinces, as a result of the disorders of the Revolution,
first moved the victims to bring their complaints
before the National Assembly. It was, perhaps,
an advantage that the ripe fruit of liberty did
not fall into their laps, but that they had to exert
themselves energetically to obtain it; for thus liberty
became the more precious to them.</p>

<p>The storming of the Bastille had finally torn the
scepter from the deluded king, and handed it over<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_437" id="Page_437">437</a></span>
to the people. The Revolution had tasted blood,
and began to inflict punishment upon the tyrants.
In many parts of the land, as if by agreement,
castles were burnt down, monasteries destroyed,
and the nobility maltreated or slain. The people,
brought up in ignorance by the Church, and now
released from the chains of slavery, knew not how
to distinguish friend from foe, and rushed recklessly
upon what lay nearest their stupid gaze. In Alsace
the lower classes of the people at the same time
made a fierce attack upon the Jews (beginning of
August, 1789)&mdash;perhaps incited by secret Jew-haters&mdash;destroying
their houses, plundering their property,
and forcing them to flee half-naked. They, who
hitherto had been humiliated and enslaved by the
nobles and the clergy, were now fellow-sufferers with
their tyrants. The Alsatian Jews mostly escaped
to Basle, and although no Jew was allowed to
live there, the fugitives were sheltered and sympathetically
treated. Complaints were made to the
National Assembly of the excesses after the first
draught of liberty; from that Assembly all expected
help, no longer from the monarchy, which had already
become a mere shadow. Every deputy received
detailed reports of disquieting, sometimes sanguinary,
events. The ill-treated Jews of Alsace had
turned to Gr√©goire, and he sketched (August 3) a
gloomy picture of the outrages upon the Jews, and
added that he, a servant of a religion which regards
all men as brothers, requested the interference of
the powerful arm of the Assembly on behalf of this
despised and unhappy people. He also published a
pamphlet, called "Proposals in Favor of the Jews,"
to influence public opinion. Then followed the
memorable night of the Fourth of August, which
covered the French nation with eternal fame, when
the nobles sacrificed their privileges on the altar of
freedom, and acknowledged the equality of all citizens&mdash;the
birth-hour of a new order of things. In<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_438" id="Page_438">438</a></span>
consequence of this agitation, and dreading that
they might fall victims to anarchy, the Jews of the
various provinces resolved to present petitions for
admission into the fraternity of the French people;
but again they acted singly, and to some extent
preferred contradictory requests. The Jews of
Bordeaux had already joined the National Guard,
and one was even appointed captain. They had
only one desire, that their equalization be sealed by
law, and this wish their four deputies, David Gradis,
Furtado, Lopes-Dubec, and Rodrigues, publicly
expressed. About a hundred Parisian Jews were
also enrolled in the National Guard, and rivaled the
other citizens in patriotism and revolutionary spirit.
They sent eleven deputies to the National Assembly,
who prayed for the removal of the ignominy which
covered them as Jews, and for equalization by law,
saying that the example of the French people would
induce all the nations of the earth to acknowledge
the Jews as brothers. The community of Metz
desired besides that their oppressive taxes be
removed, and the debts which they had contracted
in consequence of the taxes be made void. The
communities of Lorraine sent a delegate to the
National Assembly, Berr Isaac Berr (born 1744;
died 1828), who, a man of many virtues and merits,
and an admirer of Mendelssohn and Wessely, had
great influence. He drew up a petition containing
the special request that the authority and autonomy
of the rabbis in internal affairs be established and
recognized by law. The deputies for L√ºneville and
an adjacent community protested against this. It
was a long time, however, before the Jewish question
became the distinct order of the day. The
National Assembly seemed to shrink from discussing
the point, for fear of stirring up public opinion
still more passionately in the German provinces
with their obstinate prejudices and hatred of Jews.</p>

<p>Religious intolerance manifested itself even in<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_439" id="Page_439">439</a></span>
the Assembly. On the 23d of August an exciting
sitting was held. The subject of debate was
whether the inviolable rights of man, to be placed
at the head of the constitution, were to include
religious freedom of conscience and freedom of
worship. A deputy, De Castellane, had formulated
this point plainly: "No man shall be molested on
account of his religious opinions, nor disturbed in
the practice of his belief." Against this motion a
storm arose on the part of the Catholic Clergy and
other representatives of Catholicism. They continually
spoke of a dominant religion or confession,
which, as hitherto, should be supported by the State,
whilst other creeds might be tolerated. In vain
Mirabeau raised a bold protest against such presumptuousness.</p>

<blockquote>

<p>"The unrestricted freedom of belief is so sacred in my eyes, that
even the word tolerance sounds despotic to me, because the very
existence of an authority empowered to tolerate, injures freedom, in
that it tolerates, because it might do the reverse."</p></blockquote>

<p>But his powerful voice was drowned by the opposing
clamor. The clever speech of another
deputy, Rabaud Saint Etienne, however, gained the
victory for freedom of conscience. He spoke also
on behalf of the Jews.</p>

<blockquote>

<p>"I demand liberty for the nation of the Jews, always contemned,
homeless, wandering over the face of the whole globe, and doomed
to humiliation. Banish forever the aristocracy of thought, the feudal
system of opinion, which desires to rule others and impose compulsion
upon them."</p></blockquote>

<p>Amidst strong opposition the law was passed,
which has since become the basis of the European
constitution:</p>

<blockquote>

<p>"No one shall be molested on account of his religious opinions,
in so far as their outward expression does not disturb public order as
established by law."</p></blockquote>

<p>Therewith one point in the petition of the French
Jews was disposed of. But when the Jewish question
afterwards came on for treatment (September 3),<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_440" id="Page_440">440</a></span>
it was postponed, and handed over to a committee.
Three weeks later the Assembly was again obliged
to deal with the Jewish question. Persecutions
which the Jews underwent in certain places forced
it upon them. Those in Nancy were threatened
with pillage, because they were reproached with
having bought up provisions and raised the prices.
The Jewish question became so pressing, that the
order of the day (on September 28) was interrupted
by it. It was again Gr√©goire who defended the
persecuted. He was supported by Count Clermont-Tonnerre,
a sincere friend of liberty. With
glowing eloquence he pointed out that Christian
society was guilty of the degradation of the Jews,
and that it must offer them some atonement. The
Assembly thereupon resolved that the president
address a circular letter to the various towns,
stating that the declaration of the rights of man,
which the Assembly had accepted, comprehended
all men upon earth, therefore also the Jews, who
were no longer to be harassed. The king, with
his enfeebled authority, was asked to protect the
Jews from further persecutions. This action, however,
produced no results for the sufferers. The
Jews of Alsace remained exposed to attack, as
before. The Jewish representatives of the three
bishoprics of Alsace and Lorraine lost patience,
seeing that their equalization was being constantly
deferred. They therefore strove to obtain a hearing
for themselves. Introduced by the deputies of
Lorraine to the National Assembly (October 14),
Berr, the indefatigable advocate of his co-religionists,
delivered a speech, in which he portrayed the
sufferings of a thousand years, and implored humane
treatment for them. He worthily fulfilled his task.
He was obliged to be brief; the Assembly, which
had to establish a new edifice upon the ruins of the
old kingdom, could not spare time for long speeches.
President Preteau replied that the Assembly would<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_441" id="Page_441">441</a></span>
feel itself happy to be able to afford rest and happiness
to the Jews of France. The meeting applauded
his words, permitted the Jewish deputies to be
present as guests at the proceedings, and promised
to take the equalization of the Jews into consideration
at the next sitting. From this time the French Jews
confidently hoped that their emancipation would be
realized.</p>

<p>Meanwhile, the Revolution had again made a
gigantic stride forward: the people had brought the
proud French sovereign like a prisoner from Versailles
to Paris. The deputies also moved to Paris,
and the capital became more and more infected with
revolutionary fever. The youthful Parisian Jews, as
well as the immigrants, took great interest in all
occurrences. Even the middle classes aided the
cause of the fatherland by supplying funds. At
length the Jewish question was to be settled. A
deputy was appointed to report upon it, and a special
sitting called. But it was brought into connection
with another question, namely, the franchise of
executioners, actors, and Protestants, to whom the
Catholic population in some towns did not wish to
grant permission to vote.</p>

<p>The report was sent in by Clermont-Tonnerre,
and spoke most logically in favor of all four classes.
All sincere friends of liberty, Robespierre, Duport,
Barnave, and, of course, Mirabeau, expressed themselves
in favor of the Jews and their fellow-sufferers.
The followers of the old school opposed them with
determination, chief among them Abb√© Maury,
Bishop La Fare of Nancy, and the bishop of Clermont.
Only one ultra-revolutionist, Reubell, from Alsace,
spoke against the Jews, maintaining that it was dangerous
forthwith to grant complete rights of citizenship
to those resident in Alsace, against whom there
was deeply-rooted hatred. Abb√© Maury produced
utterly false, or partially true statements, as arguments
for unfriendly behavior towards the Jews.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_442" id="Page_442">442</a></span>
He even quoted Voltaire's anti-Jewish writings in
order to prejudice the Assembly. The Assembly
hesitated; it feared to attack the gross prejudice
entertained by the populace of the eastern provinces
against the Jews. At the representation of one of
the deputies, the equalization of the Jews was separated
from that of the Protestants, and the resolution
ran in this equivocal manner: that the Assembly
reserved to itself the right of deciding about the
Jews, without determining upon anything new concerning
them. This reservation was repeated at
the discussion of the laws for the election of municipal
officers (January 8, 1790), from which Jews
were excluded.</p>

<p>This evasive decision grossly offended the Portuguese
Jews of Bordeaux. Hitherto they had tacitly
enjoyed all the rights of citizens, and in their turn
fulfilled all their duties with self-sacrificing readiness.
Now they were to be kept in uncertainty about their
civil status, in company with the German Jews, against
whom they bore an antipathy not less than that
of hostile Christians. They therefore hastily despatched
a deputation to Paris to cause this injurious
resolution to be rescinded. As the population
were on better terms with the Portuguese, their
request was easily obtained. The deputy for Bordeaux,
De S√®ze, spoke warmly on their behalf.
Talleyrand, then bishop of Autun, was appointed
to report upon the matter, and concisely suggested
(February 28), that those Jews who had hitherto
enjoyed civil rights as naturalized Frenchmen should
continue to enjoy that privilege. The enemies of
the Jews, of course, opposed this motion, fearing
that it would apply also to German Jews.</p>

<p>Nevertheless, the majority decided that those
Jews in France who were called Portuguese,
Spaniards, or Avignonese (of Bordeaux and Bayonne)
should enjoy full privileges as active citizens,
and the king at once approved of this law. It was<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_443" id="Page_443">443</a></span>
the first legal recognition of the Jews as citizens,
and, though only a partial recognition, it at least
would serve as a precedent.</p>

<p>The deputies of the Jews from German districts
did not so easily attain success; they had to struggle
hard for equality. At the same time they lighted
upon a means whereby to bring pressure to bear
upon the National Assembly, and induce them to
concede them full citizenship. There were five men
who worked most perseveringly to remove all
obstacles. They won over to their side the fiery,
eloquent advocate Godard, to plead their cause
with pen and tongue. They knew that power was
no longer in the hands of the National Assembly,
but had been seized by the parties of the capital, who,
with their revolutionary ardor, held complete sway
over Paris, the deliberating Assembly, the king,
almost the whole country. The Jewish representatives
from Paris, Alsace, and Lorraine therefore
turned to them for help. They had Godard draw
up a petition to the National Assembly, stating that
the emancipation of the Jews was not only demanded
by the principles of the Constituent Assembly and
by justice, but that it was cruelty to withhold it.
For, so long as their equality was not legally
established, the people would believe that they were
indeed the outcasts their enemies had described
them to be. But even more efficacious than this
petition was a scene which the Parisian Jews
arranged with their advocate, before the General
Assembly of the Paris Commune; it decided the
question. Fifty Jewish members of the National
Guards, adorned with cockades, among them Salkind
Hurwitz, the Pole, appeared as deputies before the
Assembly of the Commune, and petitioned that the
city of Paris itself should energetically set about
obtaining equality for the Jews. Godard delivered
a fiery speech in their support. The president of
the General Assembly, Abb√© Mulot, replied to this<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_444" id="Page_444">444</a></span>
vigorous address with the fervid eloquence peculiar to
the orators of the Revolution: "The chasm between
their religious conceptions and the truth which we
as Christians profess, cannot hinder us as men from
approaching each other, and even if we reproach
each other with our errors and complain of each
other, at least we can love each other." In the
name of the meeting he promised to support the
petition of the Paris Jews for equalization. Next
day (January 29, 1790), the Jews of Paris obtained
a certificate, couched in most flattering terms, and
testifying to their excellent reputation, from the
inhabitants of the district of the Carmelites, where
most Jews dwelt at this time.</p>

<p>The six deputies appointed for the district of the
Carmelites then went to the City Hall, to support
the resolution in favor of the Jews. One of them,
Cahier de Gerville, afterwards a minister, delivered
an impressive address. "Do not be surprised,"
said he, "that this district hastens to be the first to
make public recognition of the patriotism, the courage,
and the nobility of the Jews who dwell in it.
No citizen has proved himself more zealous for the
gaining of liberty than the Jew, ... none has
displayed more sense of order and justice, none
shown more benevolence towards the poor, and
readiness in voluntarily contributing towards the
expenses of the district. Let us attack all prejudices,
and attack them with determination. Let
not one of the monstrosities of despotism and
ignorance survive the new birth of liberty and the
consecration of the rights of man.... Take
into consideration the just and pressing demands in
favor of our new brethren, and join your wishes to
their petition, so that thus united they may come
before the National Assembly. Do not doubt but
that you will obtain, without trouble, for the Jews of
Paris that which was not denied the Jews of Portugal,
Spain, and Avignon. What reason is there for<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_445" id="Page_445">445</a></span>
showing a preference for this class? Do not all
Jews hold the same doctrines? Are not our political
conditions alike for the one as for the other?
If the ancestors of those Jews on whose behalf we
plead experienced more bitter suffering and persecution
than the Portuguese Jews, then this long,
cruel oppression which they have sustained should
give them a new claim to national justice. For the
rest, look to the origin of these strange and unjust
distinctions, and see whether any one to-day dares
set up a distinction of rights between two classes of
the same people, two branches of the same stem,
basing his action upon apocryphal tradition, or
rather upon chimeras and fables."</p>

<p>To this speech the President Abb√© Mulot replied,
bringing into prominence the fact that the report
from the district of the Carmelites was to be considered
of great weight in favor of the Jews.</p>

<p>The next speech, that of Abb√© Bertolio, at length
induced the meeting to add its favorable testimony
to the Jews of Paris, and to express the wish to the
National Assembly that these Jews, most of them
of German birth, be put on an equal footing with
the Portuguese. Mayor Bailly and his committee
on the same day passed the resolution, that as soon
as the other districts announced their approval, the
whole weight of the influence of the municipality of
Paris be exerted on behalf of the equalization of the
Jews. In the course of the following month all the
city districts, with the exception of that of the
Halles, sent in their approval of the decision of the
Carmelite district. Accordingly, a deputation of
the Commune, together with its president, Abb√©
Mulot, officially commissioned by the capital (February
25), presented itself at the meeting of the
National Assembly, to request, or rather by moral
suasion to compel, that body to extend to Jews
resident in Paris the decree declaring the Portuguese
Jews full citizens.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_446" id="Page_446">446</a></span>
After some delay, certain deputies demanded
(April 15) that the Jewish question be placed on the
order of the day. Abb√© Maury again opposed the
motion, and promised to present a memorial which
the Jews should be called upon to answer. In
order, however, to protect the Jews of Alsace from
the attacks of mobs, the Assembly again decreed
that they were under protection of the laws, and
that the magistrates and the National Guard were
to take precautions for their security. In this way
they appeased their consciences. The king forthwith
sanctioned (April 18) the law of protection for
the Alsatian Jews, after which the question was not
broached for three months.</p>

<p>Fortunately the Jewish question did not stand
isolated, but was connected with other questions.
The Jews of Alsace, especially those of Metz, had
to pay high protection-taxes. When the subject of
finances came on for discussion, the Assembly had
to determine whether this tax should continue or
cease. They came to a liberal decision, although
the deputies were sorely troubled about the deficit
thus created. The secretary of the committee of
the crown land, Vismes, first showed how unjust it
was that the community of Metz, which Louis XIV,
once when in good humor, had given to the Duke
of Brancas and the Countess De Fontaine, should
pay annually to the house of Brancas 20,000 francs.
He therefore proposed that the Jew taxes should
be remitted without any indemnification, and that
every tribute, under whatever name&mdash;protection-money,
residence-tax, or tolerance-money&mdash;should
cease. This proposal was passed into law (July 20)
almost without opposition. Louis XVI, who by
this act saw another remnant of the Middle Ages
vanish, at first showed himself tardy in confirming
the law (August 7). Ten years previously the Jews
of Alsace had in vain presented a memorial to the
state council detailing the misery of their condition;<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_447" id="Page_447">447</a></span>
it received no notice. Owing to the sudden revolution
of affairs, they now achieved in less than an
hour more than they had ever dared hope for.</p>

<p>But the National Assembly would not proceed to
deal with the chief demand of the Jews of the Lower
Rhine&mdash;as these districts were then called&mdash;to
grant them civil rights. Several had expressed
themselves favorably, when the Duc de Broglie
intervened with a violent speech. He asserted
that the proposed resolution would engender new
causes of excitement in Lorraine and Alsace,
already in a state of ferment owing to the action of
the clergy who refused to take the oath. Strasburg
was likewise greatly excited on account of the Jews,
who desired to settle there, where hitherto no Jew
had been permitted. De Broglie further remarked
that the general body of Jews in Alsace was utterly
indifferent to citizenship; that the petition presented
in their name was an intrigue carried on by four or
five Jews; especially one, who had amassed a great
fortune at the expense of the state (Cerf Berr), was
scattering large sums of money most liberally in
Paris, to gain adherents for the scheme of equalization.
His motion to adjourn this question till the
Constitution was finished was carried.</p>

<p>But the Constitution was definitely fixed and
ratified by the king (September, 1791), and the
German-speaking Jews of France did not obtain the
equality so often promised. Only the paragraph
in the "Rights of Man," which said that no one
might be molested on account of his religious opinions,
benefited them. At last, a few days before the
dissolution of the National Assembly, the Jews were
remembered by one of the friends of liberty, Duport,
a member of the Jacobin Club, formerly a parliamentary
councilor. In a speech of a few words he procured
the equality they so much desired. He drew
the natural conclusion from the above-quoted rights
of religious freedom, and said, "I believe that freedom<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_448" id="Page_448">448</a></span>
of thought does not permit any distinction in political
rights on account of a man's creed. The recognition
of this equality is always being postponed. Meanwhile
the Turks, Moslems, and men of all sects, are
permitted to enjoy political rights in France. I
demand that the motion for adjournment be withdrawn,
and a decree passed that the Jews in France
enjoy the privileges of citizenship (citoyens actifs)."
This proposition was accepted amid loud applause.
In vain did Reubell strive to oppose the motion, he
was interrupted. Another member suggested that
every one who spoke against this motion be called
to order, because he would be opposing the Constitution
itself. Thus the National Assembly adopted
(September 27, 1791) Duport's proposal, and next
day formulated the law that all exceptional regulations
against Jews be abrogated, and that the
German Jews be admitted to the oath of citizenship.
Two days later the National Assembly was dissolved,
to make way for a still more violent revolutionary
assembly. A few days later Louis XVI
confirmed this full equalization of the French Jews
(November 13, 1791). They were not required to
swerve one iota from their religion as the price of
emancipation; all demanded of them being that
they forego certain ancient privileges.</p>

<p>Berr Isaac Berr was justified in rejoicing at this
success, in which he had had a large share. He at
once despatched a letter of congratulation to his
co-religionists, to rouse enthusiasm for their newly-attained
freedom, and at the same time incline them
to appropriate improvements.</p>

<blockquote>

<p>"At length the day has arrived on which the veil is torn asunder
which covered us with humiliation! We have at last again obtained
the rights of which we have been deprived for eighteen centuries.
How deeply at this moment should we recognize the wonderful grace
of the God of our forefathers! On the 27th September we were the
only inhabitants of this great realm who seemed doomed to eternal
humiliation and slavery, and on the very next day, a memorable
day which we shall always commemorate, didst Thou inspire these
immortal legislators of France to utter one word which caused 60,000<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_449" id="Page_449">449</a></span>
unhappy beings, who had hitherto lamented their hard lot, to be
suddenly plunged into the intoxicating joys of the purest delight."</p>

<p>"God chose the noble French nation to reinstate us in our due
privileges, and bring us to a new birth, just as in former days He
selected Antiochus and Pompey to degrade and oppress us....
This nation asks no thanks, except that we show ourselves worthy
citizens."</p></blockquote>

<p>Berr added certain important, timely remarks, in
which he gently pointed out to his French co-religionists
faults growing out of their former wretched
plight, and admonished them to remove these faults.</p>

<p>He also supplied the French Jews with means to
enable them to become thorough Frenchmen and
at the same time remain members of the House of
Jacob. The Bible was to be rendered into French
on the basis of Mendelssohn's German translation,
and put into the hands of the young, so that the
corrupt German language which they used might be
completely banished from their midst. Berr thus
attacked a foolish prejudice which regarded the
German or Jewish-German dialect as akin in sanctity
to the Hebrew, therefore a more worthy organ
for Divine Service than the language of Voltaire.</p>

<p>Berr was thoroughly imbued with the conviction
that Judaism was in every way compatible with
liberty, civilization, and patriotism for the country
which had restored to his co-religionists their rights
as men. Berr was a better disciple of Mendelssohn
than David Friedl√§nder and the Berlin Jews.</p>

<p>With great assiduity and self-sacrifice, most of
the French Jews interested themselves in the welfare
of the state which had given them a fatherland,
liberty, and equality. They destroyed at one blow
all the calumniations of their opponents, who had
asserted that as Jews they would not be able to
fulfill the duties of citizens. They came to the
front whenever the state stood in need of help.
A large number of Jews in this feverish time calling
forth courageous action, threw aside with wonderful
rapidity the shy, grovelling manner which had<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_450" id="Page_450">450</a></span>
debarred them from intercourse with the world, and
had subjected them to general ridicule. When the
French legions, inspired by freedom, had put to
rout the mercenary troops of Germany, Moses
Ensheim, the Hebrew poet of the Mendelssohn
school, composed a fiery triumphal hymn, similar
to the song of Deborah, which was solemnly chanted
in the synagogue. The Jews, however, took no
part whatever in the bloody atrocities of the Revolution.</p>

<p>In the frenzy of the Reign of Terror, which like a
scourge of God fell upon the innocent and the
guilty, some Jews also suffered. The familiarity of
the Jews with persecutions, their acuteness, and
the dexterity with which they effaced themselves,
their obedience to the precept, "Bend thy head a
moment, till the storm is passed," protected them
against wide-spread massacre. In general, they
were not stirred by the ambition to thrust themselves
forward, or a desire to take part in affairs;
nor did they give offense to the rulers of the hour.
Thus the storm of the Revolution rushed over them
without serious results.</p>

<p>The attack upon a belief in God, when the two
blaspheming deputies, Chaumette and Hebert,
succeeded in inducing the convention (November,
1793-May, 1794) to set up the religion of Reason,
had likewise no effect upon the Jews. The intense
hostility and anger felt to religion and the Divinity
were directed only against Catholicism, or Christianity,
by whose servants mankind had ever been
degraded, who themselves had sacrificed myriads of
victims, and during the Revolution had fomented a
civil war. The Reign of Terror, the Massacre of
September, and the Guillotine, had been conjured
up by them almost as a sad, stern necessity, because,
together with the feudal aristocracy, they
were bitter enemies of freedom. The decree of
the Convention ran thus: "The Catholic faith is<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_451" id="Page_451">451</a></span>
annulled, and replaced by the worship of Reason."
This represented not alone the mood of the most
advanced, the Jacobins; it was the inclination of the
French people to oppose the Church and its followers
fiercely, because of a feeling that they are
naturally hostile to liberty. Twenty days after the
resolution of the Convention had been passed,
more than 2,300 churches were transformed into
Temples of Reason. The law included no provisions
against Jews and Protestants. Only the magistrates
or fanatically inclined members of clubs in
the provinces, principally, it appears, in the old
German districts, extended the order for the suppression
of religion to the Jews also. In Nancy an
official demanded of the Jews of the town, in the
name of the city council, that they attend on an appointed
day at the National Temple, and together
with the clergy of other creeds renounce "their
superstition," and further surrender all the silver
and golden vessels of the synagogue. Brutal and
riotous men forced their way into the synagogues,
tore the Holy Writings from the Arks and burnt
them, or searched the houses for books written in
Hebrew in order to destroy them. Prayers in the
synagogues of certain congregations were forbidden
just as in the churches. By reason of the spy system
which the revolutionary clubs supported, to enable
them to oppose the imminent counter-revolution,
even private meetings for religious purposes
were attended with great danger. When the order
of the Convention was issued, decreeing that every
tenth day be observed as a day of rest, and making
Sunday a working day, the Mayors of certain cities,
as of Strasburg and Troyes, extended this decree
also to the Sabbath. They commanded that Jewish
merchants display their wares for sale on the
Sabbath. In agricultural districts Jews were compelled,
on the Sabbath and on Jewish Holidays, to
mow and gather in the crops, and rabbis as well as<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_452" id="Page_452">452</a></span>
bishops were molested. David Sinzheim, who
lived in Strasburg, and afterwards became president
of the great French Synhedrion, was forced to flee
from town to town to escape imprisonment or
death. In Metz the Jews dared not openly bake
their Passover cakes, until a clever Jewish matron
had the courage to explain to the officers of the
Revolution that this bread had always been a symbol
of freedom with the Jews. In Paris Jewish
schoolmasters were compelled to conduct their
pupils to the Temple of Reason into which the
church of Notre Dame had been transformed on
the D√©cadi. However, this persecution passed
away without any serious effects. With the victory
of the Thermidorians (9 Thermidor&mdash;July 27, 1794)
over Robespierre, the Reign of Terror began to die
out. The populace was anxious to resort to milder
means. The equalization of the French Jews, once
definitely settled, remained untouched through all
changes of government. The new Constitution of
the year Three of the Republic, or the Constitution
of the Directory (autumn of 1795), recognized the
adherents of Judaism, without further difficulty, as
on an equal footing with all around them; moreover,
it wiped away the last trace of inequality, inasmuch
as the Catholic Church was no more than the synagogue
acknowledged to be the state church. The
law laid down the fundamental proposition, that no
one can be compelled to contribute to the expenses
of a church establishment, as the Republic subsidized
none. Only the community of Metz had
to suffer under some baneful effects of the Middle
Ages.</p>

<p>Together with the victorious French troops of
the Republic, the deliverance of the Jews, of the
most oppressed race of the ancient world, advanced
from one place to another. It took firm root in
Holland, which had been changed into a Batavian
Republic (beginning of 1795). Here several energetic<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_453" id="Page_453">453</a></span>
Jews, among them Asser (Moses and Carolus),
De Lemon, and Bromet, had joined a club, called
Felix Libertate, which had taken the motto of the
French Republic&mdash;Liberty, Equality, and Fraternity.</p>

<p>These state maxims were on the whole adopted
by the assembled States General (March 4, 1795).
Although the 50,000 Jews of Holland, who formed
the thirty-ninth part of the whole population of the
country, and were divided into the Portuguese and
German communities, might justly have regarded
this land as their Paradise, they had hitherto been
laboring under many disadvantages as compared
with Christians. They were suffered to exist only
as corporate bodies, little commonwealths, as it were,
in the midst of larger ones. That they were excluded
from public offices did not trouble them. But
they were also debarred from several trade-guilds,
and this was a matter of great importance to them.
They had to contribute to the ruling church establishment
and to its schools without deriving any benefit
therefrom. Also, there was no lack of vexatious
grievances. In Amsterdam, for instance, when a
Jewish couple went to register their wedding, they
were compelled to wait till Christians had been
attended to, and, besides, to pay double fees. On
this account the demand for equalization became
pressing, more on the part of the German than on that
of the Portuguese Jews, the latter, wealthy and of
noble birth, being generally treated with distinction
by the patricians, whilst the Germans were despised
as wretched Poles. In the first excitement of the
agitation several disabilities of the Jews of Holland
or Batavia were removed, and voices were raised in
favor of their admission to full civil rights. But
later on, as in France, writings hostile to the Jews
roused public opinion against them. Amongst these
Van Swieden's work, entitled "Advice to the Representatives
of the People," especially produced a
great impression.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_454" id="Page_454">454</a></span>
He asserted that owing to their origin, their
character, their history, and their belief in the
Messiah, the Jews remained strangers, and could
not be absorbed by the state. This statement was
in a measure accepted by the official representatives
of Judaism as correct. For strangely enough the
rabbis and administrators of Jewish affairs, especially
the powerful Parnassim in Amsterdam, alike in the
Portuguese and German communities, were averse
to equalization. They feared that Judaism would
suffer from the great freedom of the Jews and from
their new duties, such as military service.</p>

<p>In a circular letter they declared that the Jews
renounced citizenship, seeing that it was opposed to
the commands of Holy Writ. Within a short time
this declaration was covered with more than one
thousand signatures. Although Jews were invited,
but few took part in the election of the first Batavian
National Assembly (Nationale Vergadering). Thus
it happened that Amsterdam, which contained more
than 20,000 Jews, did not return a single Jewish
deputy. The Jewish friends of liberty in Holland
were in a sorry plight, having to combat enemies
within and without. They were driven to exert all
their energy to overcome this double difficulty.
David Friedrichsfeld, a member of the school of the
Measfim, who had settled in Amsterdam, composed
an excellent work (about 1795) against the assailants
of the Jews, called "Investigation of Van Swieden's
Work in Reference to the Civil Rights of the Jews."
Beside him, six distinguished and intelligent Jews&mdash;most
of them of German descent&mdash;developed the
greatest zeal to accomplish the emancipation of
the Jews of Holland. They were: Herz Bromet,
who had long lived in Surinam, where he was recognized
as a free citizen, and whence he had brought
a knowledge of politics and a fortune; Moses Asser,
who had been appointed knight of the Belgian
Order of the Lion; another Asser, Carolus, and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_455" id="Page_455">455</a></span>
Isaac de Jonghe, all distinguished members of the
German community. Only two of the Portuguese
community participated in the endeavor to obtain
equalization of rights: the highly respected physician
Herz de Lemon, and Jacob Sasportas. They presented
a petition to the Batavian National Assembly
(March 29, 1796), which held its sittings at the
Hague, demanding the emancipation of the Batavian
Jews as a right; inasmuch as they were citizens of
the Batavian Republic, possessing the franchise,
and had already exercised civil rights, they prayed
the Assembly to declare that they might enjoy this
privilege in its entirety. The National Assembly
considered the petition, and appointed a commission
to advise and decide upon it. When the Jewish
question came on for discussion (August, 1796),
excitement ran high, and the tension between the
parties was great.</p>

<p>Although the emancipation of the Jews in the
Batavian Republic had been recognized in principle,
and practically acknowledged by the permission to
vote at the election, there were still many opponents
to contend against, almost more than in France.
The conservative Dutch deputies in their hearts
believed firmly in the Bible, and they considered as
the word of God the writings of the New Testament,
in which it was said that the Jews were outcasts,
and should remain so. The relatively large
number of Jews, their wealth, respectability, and
intelligence, gave cause for grave fears that they
would make their way into the highest offices of the
state, and expel the Christians. Sixty or a hundred
thousand Jews, in the great territory of France, were
lost like a grain of sand in an immense plain, but
fifty thousand among two millions, especially twenty
thousand Jews in Amsterdam among two hundred
thousand Christians, might make themselves felt,
and effect their purpose. One of the deputies,
Lublink de Jonghe, dwelt upon this state of affairs<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_456" id="Page_456">456</a></span>
with great emphasis. If the friends of the Jews
pointed to America, where, as in France, they had
recently attained to full civil rights, then he brought
into prominence the unequal proportion of numbers;
in Holland their great number would soon invest
the populace with Jewish characteristics. The noble
Portuguese might be admitted to full rights; but as
to the German Jews, the majority of whom were
outcasts, Lublink de Jonghe quoted Pinto's work
against Voltaire, in which he, a Jew himself, had
plainly shown the vast difference between the Portuguese
and the German Jews. Thus the artificial
caste feeling, within the fold of Judaism, brought
about its own revenge. The fear was still greater
that the number of the Jews in Holland might be
considerably increased by immigrants from Germany
and Poland, whose goal, for a long time past, had
been Amsterdam. Opponents to the scheme of
equalization could further adduce the argument
that the majority of Jews did not desire emancipation,
and that the six petitioners had acted without
authority. Noel, the French ambassador, in somewhat
imperious fashion, took the first step in favor
of the equalization of the Jews. After a long debate,
the complete equality of the Batavian Jews was
finally decreed (September 2, 1796), with the addition,
for those who wished to make use of it. Thereupon
all earlier provincial and municipal laws which
referred to their disabilities were abolished.</p>

<p>The Jews in Holland did not receive the announcement
of this decision with joy, as those in France,
when the rights of equality had been granted them.
They had not felt the deprivation of liberty enough
to go into ecstasies about their new freedom. They
had no ambition to obtain state offices, and saw in
citizenship only a burden and a danger to religion.
They therefore were embittered against those who
had procured their equalization, and so had broken
asunder the bonds which held the two congregations<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_457" id="Page_457">457</a></span>
together as corporate bodies. Thus there arose
causes for dispute and internal dissension in Amsterdam.</p>

<p>The liberal-minded, most of whom belonged to
the German community, demanded that the regulations
which endowed the rabbis, and to a greater
extent the Parnassim, or wardens, with powerful
authority over the members, should be altered in
accordance with the spirit of the age. The leaders
of the community not only refused this demand,
but even threatened the petitioners with fines.
Upon this the advanced left the existing synagogue,
established their own congregation, and declared
that they constituted the real community (Adath
Jeshurun, formed at the end of 1796). The conservative
members of the old community thereupon
passed a kind of interdict upon the separatists, forbade
their own congregants to have any intercourse,
or to intermarry with them. The political divergence
of opinion at the same time became a religious one;
for the supporters of the new congregation,
Adath Jeshurun, initiated a sort of reform.
They struck out of their ritual the formula of imprecation
(v'la-Malshinim), which had originally
been directed against the apostate Jewish Christians,
but by misinterpretation was afterwards
applied to all Christians. They abolished the
practice of hastily burying the dead, and erected a
new, clean communal bath,&mdash;innocent reforms,
which, however, were regarded by the strictly orthodox
as grave offenses against Judaism. The new
congregation succeeded in having the fanatical
leaders of the German community, who were more
inconsiderate than the Portuguese in their opposition
to those who had withdrawn from their midst,
removed from their posts, probably through the
action of the French ambassador Noel. Among
the new council officers, members of the new congregation
were elected. Gradually many of the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_458" id="Page_458">458</a></span>
old party became reconciled to the new order of
things and to the aspirations of the liberal-minded
section. The orthodox were also greatly flattered
when two Jews, Bromet and De Lemon, were
elected as deputies for Amsterdam. Several attended
at the Hague at the opening of the second
National Assembly (September 1, 1797), to participate
in the honor of the Jewish deputies. They
were still more pleased with the idea of equalization
when the Jewish deputy, Isaac da Costa Atias, was
successively elected a member of the city council,
of the National Assembly, and finally to the position
of President of the same (1798). The head
of the Batavian Republic, the Grand Pensioner
Schimmelpenink, was in earnest about the emancipation
of the Jews, and without hesitation appointed
able Jews to public offices. The first appointment
to public posts in Europe was made in Holland.</p>

<p>It was natural that a sense of self-importance and
honorable pride should be awakened in the breasts
of the liberal members of the new congregation,
among whom state offices were distributed. Indignation
seized them when they saw that the Jews
under the German princes were still treated as
outcasts or wild beasts. They therefore laid a proposal
before the National Assembly, entreating
that the Batavian ambassador to the French Republic
be instructed to move at the Peace Congress
held at Rastadt, that the Dutch Jews in Germany
should no longer be compelled to pay poll-tax, and
to threaten that, unless this was granted, all Germans
journeying through Holland would be subjected
to the same dishonorable treatment. The
National Assembly agreed to this proposition.</p>

<p>Righteous judgment soon overtook the German
princes and people, who, stubborn as Pharaoh and
the Egyptians, refused to loosen the chain of slavery
from the Jews. They themselves were soon
forced to become the <i>servi camer√¶</i> of the French<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_459" id="Page_459">459</a></span>
Republic, and to pay a poll-tax. Wherever in
Germany and Italy the courageous French obtained
firm footing, the Jews were made free. The walls
of the Ghetto were burst open, and bent figures
stood erect.</p>

<p>The name of the invincible French, who had
achieved wonderful victories in Italy, quickly spread
abroad, even beyond Europe, and aroused terror
and surprise in the most remote countries. A new
Alexander, the Corsican Bonaparte, a god of war
when scarcely thirty years old, set out with a comparatively
small army to subdue Egypt, and hoped
to penetrate to India. In less than six months
(July-November, 1798) Egypt lay crushed at his
feet. But a Turkish army was on its way to meet
him, against which Bonaparte advanced into Palestine.
Thus, through a marvelous series of historical
events, the Holy Land became the scene of a bloody
war between the representatives of the old and the
new spirit in Europe.</p>

<p>El Arish and Gaza in the south-west of Palestine
fell into the hands of the French army, which
scarcely numbered 12,000 men (17th and 25th
February, 1799). The Jewish community of Gaza
had fled. In Jerusalem the news of French victories
and cruelty created a panic. It was rumored
that Napoleon was about to enter the Holy City.
At the command of the sub-pasha, or Motusallim,
the inhabitants began to throw up ramparts, the
Jews taking part in the work. One of their rabbis,
Mordecai Joseph Meyuchas, encouraged and even
assisted them in their operations. The Turks had
circulated the report that the French treated Jews
particularly in a cruel manner. Bonaparte had
issued a summons to the Asiatic and African Jews
to march under his banners, promising to give them
the Holy Land, and restore ancient Jerusalem to its
pristine splendor. But the Jews in Jerusalem appear
either not to have trusted in these flattering<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_460" id="Page_460">460</a></span>
words, or to have been utterly ignorant of the proclamation.
Probably it was only a trick on the
part of Bonaparte, intended to win over to his side
the Jewish minister of the pasha of Acco, Chayim
Maalem Farchi (assassinated in 1820), the soul of
the defense of the important sea-fortress of Acco.
Had Bonaparte succeeded in conquering Syria and
carrying the war into the heart of Turkey, he would
perhaps have assigned a share in his government to
members of the Jewish nation upon whom the
French could rely. But the appearance of Bonaparte
in Palestine was like that of a terrible meteor,
which disappears after causing much devastation.
His dream to become Emperor of the East, and restore
Jerusalem to the Jews, quickly faded away.</p>

<p>The glowing enthusiasm for France, where his
enthralled co-religionists had been freed, had created
a Jewish poet in Elia Halevi, while a Jewish
youth was aroused to become a spirited orator,
whose eloquence was always tinged with poetry.
Michael Berr (born 1780, died 1843), a worthy son
of Isaac Berr, who had so zealously striven for the
emancipation of the Jews of France, in his youth
aroused great hopes, by reason of his handsome,
noble form, and his manifold talents. In him for
the first time Jewish and French spirit met in harmonious
combination. He was the first Jewish
attorney in France. Animated by the ambition of
courageous youth and in the glow of his fiery spirit,
this young man conceived a bold idea, at the beginning
of the new century, when peace was concluded.
A Congress of the princes of Europe was expected
to take place. To them and their people Michael
Berr addressed a "Summons" in the name of "all
the inhabitants of Europe professing the Jewish
religion," praying them to free his co-religionists
from oppression, and to guarantee to them the
justice so long withheld. This youth voiced the
hopes of rejuvenated Israel. Berr's summons was<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_461" id="Page_461">461</a></span>
especially directed to the Germans, both to princes
and nations, who still treated the Jews living in
their midst as branded <i>servi camer√¶</i>.</p>

<p>Berr, who was inspired with love for his co-religionists,
preached to deaf ears, his burning words
and convincing arguments finding no response in
the hearts of the Eastern European people. In
Austria, Prussia, and the numerous smaller German
states, the Jews remained in their former abasement.
In Berlin itself, the seat of enlightenment, Jewish
physicians, however honorable their reputation,
were not included in the list of their Christian fellow-practitioners,
but were enumerated by themselves,
relegated, as it were, to a medical Ghetto. Two
men of the first rank, the greatest poet and the
greatest thinker of the time, G√∂the and Fichte,
shared in the prejudices of the Germans against the
Jews, and made no secret of it. G√∂the, the representative
of the aristocratic world, and Fichte, the
defender of democratic opinion in Germany, both
desired to see the Jews removed like plague
patients beyond the pale of Christian society.
Both were on bad terms with the Church, both
looked upon Christianity with its belief in miracles
as a folly, and both were considered atheists. Nevertheless
they abhorred the Jews in the name of
Jesus. G√∂the's intolerance against the Jews cannot
be taken as the expression of his personal prejudice;
he only showed how the current of opinion
flowed in cultured German circles.</p>

<p>Fichte, the one-sided complement of Kant, was
still more savage and embittered against the Jews.
Like most German metaphysicians, his philosophy
was of a visionary nature before the outbreak of the
French Revolution.</p>

<p>Apparently Fichte bestowed great honor upon
the Jews when he put them on a level with the
nobility and the clergy. But he did not wish in any
way to honor them, but rather to accuse them before<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_462" id="Page_462">462</a></span>
the bar of public opinion. Fichte, the philosophical
thinker, cherished the same ill-will against the Jews
and Judaism as G√∂the, the aristocratic poet, and
Schleiermacher, the Gnostic preacher.</p>

<p>Should civil rights be granted to Jews? Fichte
opposed it in a most decided fashion; not even in
the Christian state, in his view a petty state, contrary
to right and reason, should they be emancipated.
"The only way I see by which civil rights
can be conceded to them (the Jews) is to cut off all
their heads in one night, and to set new ones on
their shoulders, which should contain not a single
Jewish idea. The only means of protecting ourselves
against them is to conquer their promised
land and send them thither." History judged otherwise:
new heads have not been set on the Jews,
but on the Germans themselves. His view was
that Jews should not be persecuted, that, in fact,
the rights of men should be granted them, "because
they are men," but that they should be banished
altogether. Even the clerical opponents of emancipation
in France, Abb√© Maury and Bishop La
Fare, had not spoken of the Jews in so perverse
and hateful a manner. Fichte may be regarded as
the father and apostle of national German hatred of
the Jews, of a kind unknown before, or rather never
before so clearly manifested. Even Herder, although
filled with admiration for Israel's antiquity
and the people in its biblical splendor,&mdash;the first to
examine sacred literature from a poetical point of
view&mdash;felt an aversion to the Jews, which became
apparent in his relations with Mendelssohn, whom
it cost him an effort to treat in a friendly manner.
Herder, it is true, prophesied a better time, when
Christian and Jew would work together in concord
on the structure of human civilization. But like
Balaam of old, he pronounced his blessings upon
Israel in a half-hearted way. This growing hostility
to the Jews among the Germans was not noticed by<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_463" id="Page_463">463</a></span>
educated Jews who dwelt in their midst, at least they
did not combat it vigorously. Only one pamphlet
from the pen of a Jewish author appeared at this
time. Saul Asher wrote his "Eisenmenger the
Second, an open letter to Fichte," but hardly any
notice was taken of it.</p>

<p>If the Jews met with no favor in the eyes of those
who formed public opinion in Germany, who had
raised it from antiquated customs to a brilliant height
of culture, both in the democratic and in the aristocratic
camps, but experienced at their hands only
repulse and scorn, how much worse was their relation
to the great mass of the populace, still engulfed in
the depths of darkest ignorance and crudeness!
Two noble-minded Christians addressed to the Congress
of Rastadt the soundest arguments that the
German Jews should be raised from their ignominious
condition. One of them, an unknown philanthropist,
hurled the shaft of ridicule at the stupidity and
bombastic haughtiness of the German Jew-haters,
and the other, Christian Grund, demonstrated with
pitiless logic the injustice with which the Jews were
treated. Both desired to support the demand of
the Dutch Jews to the diplomatic representatives,
that the princes of Germany be compelled to respect
the Jews, and that influence be brought to bear
upon public opinion to that effect. Grund acted as
a clever advocate for the Jews; he complimented
the Germans in order to win favor with them.
"The German Jews," said he, "venture to approach
the German nation, capable of great deeds, the
creator of its own destinies, not merely an imitator
of the actions of other peoples, uniting their voice
with that of their brethren, to petition the representatives
of the nation at Rastadt most respectfully
for the abolition of those distinctions under which
they live, and for the acquisition of greater rights."
The answer of the German princes and rulers was
not very encouraging.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_464" id="Page_464">464</a></span>
The most disgraceful degradation and humiliation
of the Jews consisted in the poll-tax, an impost
unknown outside of Germany. Of what advantage
was it that Emperor Joseph of Austria and Frederick
William II had remitted it? It still existed in all
its hideousness in Central and Western Germany,
in the districts of the Main and the Rhine, where
diminutive states bordered close on other diminutive
states of the extent of a square mile, and where
turnpike after turnpike at short intervals presented
itself. If a Jew took a day's journey, he passed
through different territories, and at the borders of
each had to pay a poll-tax. A Jewish beggar, accompanied
by his young son, once exhibited his poll-tax
bills, which amounted to a florin and a half for six
days, paid in various places. The way in which the
tax was levied was more degrading than the duty of
paying it. Very often the tax amounted to a few
kreuzers, which only the poor, who were not exempt
from it, felt as a burden. But the brutal procedure
of the officers, and the ignominious treatment at
each frontier-line offended also the rich. As long
as the French armies were encamped in German
territory, the Jews escaped paying the poll-tax.
But no sooner was the peace of L√ºneville concluded,
and the French troops withdrawn, than the petty
German princes re-imposed the tax, not in order to
raise the small income derivable from this source,
but to humiliate the Jews. They inflicted the
insult also upon French Jews who crossed the
Rhine for business purposes, defending their action
by a literal construction of one of the articles of the
peace of Campo Formio, which stated: "All
business and intercourse shall for the present continue
under the same conditions as before the war."
The French Jews, proud of their citizenship, would
not submit, severed their business connections with
Germany, and complained of the injustice to the
French government, by whom the question was not<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_465" id="Page_465">465</a></span>
lightly passed over. The government commissioner
Jollivet despatched a circular letter (1801) to the
agents of the French Republic resident at German
courts, instructing them not to permit French
citizens of the Israelite faith to be degraded to
animals. They were to make earnest representations
to the governments concerned, and menace
them with retaliation. Several small princes, like
those of Solms, gave heed, and forthwith removed
the poll-tax; from fear of the French the French
Jews were freed from it, but it still weighed heavily
upon German travelers. Every step towards the
removal of oppressive restrictions in Germany was
the result of great exertions.</p>

<p>In consequence of the peace of L√ºneville, the
Holy Roman Empire was now for the first time
dismembered. The representatives of the Empire,
assembled in Ratisbon, were driven to seek means
of bringing their disunited members into some sort
of order, or to decide upon the indemnity for the
damage suffered. To this conference of the ambassadors
of eight princes, occupied with traffic in
territory, and regarded by the short-sighted as
representing the German nation, the German Jews
presented a petition asking for passive citizenship
(November 15, 1802). This entreaty was drawn
up "in the name of the Jews of Germany," by state
attorney Christopher Grund. Which congregation,
or what individuals zealous for emancipation had
commissioned him to do this is not exactly known.
It appears that the petition originated in Frankfort.
It prayed that the representatives of the Empire
remove from the German Jews the burdensome
distinctions under which they labored; that the
narrow confines in which they were forced to reside
be thrown open, so that for the sake of health and
free enjoyment of life, they might select their own
dwelling-place in the cities. Further, that the
bonds by which their population, their trade, and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_466" id="Page_466">466</a></span>
their industry were restricted to a fatal degree be
loosened, and that, in short, the Jewish community
be considered worthy, by the grant of civil rights, to
constitute one united people with the German nation.
The Jews, or their attorney Grund, cited the fact
that they were "classed with dishonorable persons,
outlaws, and serfs." The miserable condition of
the Frankfort community, which, after the orders
promulgated for the regulation of the town in 1616,
had been deprived of natural freedom, and crowded
together into the narrowest limits, served as a
conclusive proof. The example of France and the
Batavian Republic in emancipating the Jews was
adduced; but the Jews could hardly have deceived
themselves with the fond hope that the representatives
of the Empire would concede so much to them.
They hoped at least to have one restriction removed,
viz., that of the poll-tax, and this point was insisted
upon with great vigor. "The most degrading of all
these disabilities," they said, "is the poll-tax, which
removes the name of Jew from the category of
rational beings, to place it among wild beasts, and
forces him to pay his way when he sets foot upon one
soil or another." Contrary to expectation, this
petition to the representatives of the Empire was
handed in and supported by the most distinguished
member among them, the ambassador from the
Electorate of Bohemia or Austria. He proposed
the motion "that the Jews of Germany be allowed
civil rights" (at the end of 1802). Meantime the
Indemnification Congress had other affairs to engross
its attention, and its members were unable to occupy
themselves with the Jewish question. The petition
was buried under a pile of state papers.</p>

<p>Nothing was to be expected from the German
people, as those who watched the course of affairs
readily perceived. The Jews therefore directed
their zeal towards inducing the various governments
to remit the poll-tax. Two men made their<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_467" id="Page_467">467</a></span>
names famous in the struggle to remove this odious
impost, viz., Israel Jacobson and Wolff Breidenbach.
The former, court agent and finance counselor to
the Prince of Brunswick, succeeded in procuring
the abolition of the poll-tax in the territories of
Brunswick-L√ºneburg (April 23, 1803). During a
number of years Wolff Breidenbach strove in the
same cause, and effected more far-reaching results.
Breidenbach was born in a village of that name near
Cassel, 1751, and died at Offenbach 1829. He was
a man of high culture, noble ideals, and so modest
that his name has almost been forgotten in spite of
all the sacrifices he made on behalf of the German
Jews. He did not, like Jacobson, make provisions
to have his name spread far and wide.</p>

<p>Deeply moved by the annoyances, and the contemptuous
treatment inflicted on Jewish travelers in
places where the tax was imposed, which came
daily under the notice of Breidenbach in his business
journeys, he determined at least to have the poll-tax
remitted, and applied himself with all his energy to
this task. Quietly he strove to have the chain
loosened, where it weighed most heavily. He perceived
that large sums of money would be required
to provide presents for the police magistrates and
the city clergy under the pretense of giving alms to
the poor, and also "to erect beautiful monuments
in honor of magnanimous princes" who would
allow themselves to be influenced to leave the
Jews untaxed and unoppressed. He was not able to
meet this enormous expense out of his own means.
He therefore issued a summons to German and
foreign Jews (September, 1803), asking them to
subscribe to a fund, from which the cost of abolishing
the poll-tax might be defrayed. It was well
known at the time who circulated this appeal, but
out of modesty, Breidenbach did not append his
name. By these means, and through negotiations
with the minor German princes at the Diet in Ratisbon,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_468" id="Page_468">468</a></span>
carried on with the friendly help of the imperial
chancellor, Dalberg, and finally by the recommendations
of the princes themselves, who learned to
esteem him, Breidenbach succeeded in obtaining the
right of free passage for the Jews throughout the
Rhineland and Bavaria. Even the narrow-minded,
Jew-hating, most noble council of Frankfort was
moved by Breidenbach's petition to abolish the
poll-tax exacted at the gates and bridges.</p>

<p>The petition of the Jews to the representatives of
the Empire for civil privileges, however restricted,
the feeling displayed by several princes in favor of
removing their bonds, and other signs, made the
Jew-haters of Germany suspect that the old condition
of imperial serfdom would soon vanish. They
were terror-struck; they could not conceive the
idea that the down-trodden Jews should be raised
from their abasement in Germany. This painful
idea induced a host of authors, most of them jurists,
as if by mutual agreement, to employ all their efforts
in various parts of Germany in opposing the deliverance
of the Jews from slavery. Among these
men were Paalzow, Grattenauer, Buchholz, and many
anonymous writers, who persisted in their hostility
for several years (1803&ndash;1805). They displayed
hatred to the Jews, so malignant that it savored of
the days of the Black Death, of Capistrano, Pfefferkorn,
and the Dominicans. They produced an artificial
fog, to prevent the spread of rays of enlightenment.
In former days it had been the servants of
the church who had branded the Jews with dishonor.
Now the priests of justice assumed this part, and by
perversion of justice sought to keep the Jews in
servitude, for which course Fichte had prepared the
way. As soon as the petition of the Jews reached
the representatives of the Empire in Ratisbon, a
jurist of South Germany opposed it, urging that a
thousand reasons existed why Jews were unworthy
of becoming citizens of the Empire and the provinces.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_469" id="Page_469">469</a></span>
The greater number and the most obstinate
of the representatives of this Jew-baiting movement
had their seat in Berlin, the city of enlightenment
and of the Christianity taught by Schleiermacher.
The character, teachings, and history of the Jews,
even their prophets and patriarchs, in fact, everything
Jewish, was attacked by these cowardly writers,
most of whom wrote anonymously, and was made
the subject of foulest abuse and vituperation.</p>

<p>The leaders of Berlin Judaism were at a loss how
to oppose these systematic onslaughts. David
Friedl√§nder remained silent. Ben-David resolved
to write an answer, but wisely abstained. The
parts were now changed. In the days of Mendelssohn,
and for some time afterwards, the German
Jews had acted as guardians to the French Jews
whenever the latter had any grievances to redress.
Now freedom had made the French Jews so powerful
and confident that they repulsed every attack
upon themselves and their belief with courage and
skill. The Berlin Jews, who had always been ready
enough to boast of their courage, at the first hostile
attack found themselves helpless as babes. In their
perplexity they solicited the aid of the police, who
issued an order that no pamphlet either for or
against the Jews should be published. This step
was regarded by their antagonists as a sign of
cowardice or a confession of powerlessness. A new
abusive tract, entitled "Can the Jews remain in their
present condition without harm to the state?" gave
additional weight to the accusations against them.</p>

<blockquote>

<p>"What were a number of the most wealthy Jews or their fathers
twenty or thirty years ago? Hawkers, who crawled about the streets
in ragged clothes, annoying the passers-by with their importunity to
buy some yards of Potsdam hair riband; or rustics, who, under the
pretext of trading, stole into Christian dwellings, and often did damage
to their owners."</p></blockquote>

<p>This writer proposed to render the Jews harmless
by means more revolting than those employed in
the Middle Ages.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_470" id="Page_470">470</a></span></p>

<blockquote>

<p>"Not only must the Jews again be enclosed in a Ghetto, and be
placed under continual police supervision; not only should they be
compelled to wear a patch of noticeable color upon their coat sleeves,
but in order to prevent their increase, the second male child of each
Jew should be castrated."</p></blockquote>

<p>Protestant theology and German philosophy proposed
regulations against the Jews unrivaled by the
canonical decrees of Popes Innocent III and Paul IV.</p>

<p>In Breslau appeared similar libels which inflamed
the hatred of the populace against the Jews. Even
the well-meaning writings composed in their defense
by Christians, such as Kosmann and Ramson&mdash;"A
Word to the Impartial"&mdash;admitted the low character
of the Jews, and seemed to imply that in every
way it would be better for Christians if there were
no Jews among them; but seeing that the evil existed,
it must be endured. The honor of the Germans
was partly redeemed by a man who belonged
to the olden time, Freiherr von Diebitsch, once a
major in the Russian service, to whom love of mankind
was no empty phrase. He warmly defended
the Jews against the venomous attacks of Grattenauer
and his malicious allies (1803 and 1804), and
thereby laid himself open to the charge of having
been bribed. In view of the general prejudice
against the Jewish race, he was prepared to see
himself "caricatured, and represented as riding
upon a sow or an ass." His kindly but pedantic
pamphlets in defense of the Jews were not sufficient
to close the mouths of their opponents.</p>

<p>Equally inadequate and fruitless were the attempts
at vindication made by Jewish writers outside
of Berlin, who found it necessary to lift their
voice in opposition to the general outcry against
their people.</p>

<p>Two Jews, one from K√∂nigsberg, the other from
Hamburg, hit upon an excellent plan. Both recognized
that the Jew hatred of the Germans could not
be refuted by solid and weighty arguments, but
might be silenced by ridicule. They were the forerunners<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_471" id="Page_471">471</a></span>
of B√∂rne and Heine, one being an unknown
physician, the other writing anonymously (Lefrank).
The former, in a satirical pamphlet written under
the name of Dominicus Haman Epiphanes, expressed
the opinion that unless all Jews were
speedily massacred, and all Jewesses sold as slaves,
the world, Christianity, and all states, must necessarily
perish. Mankind would benefit enormously
by the sale of the Jews: all immorality would
thereby at once diminish, and the immortal Grattenauer,
who had originated the glorious idea and
had disseminated his noble abhorrence of the Jews,
would everywhere be acknowledged a benefactor of
mankind, and be deservedly commemorated by
temples and monuments.</p>

<p>The other satirist, Lefrank, called his work
"Bellerophon," (or the defeated Grattenauer). He
wished to kill the chimerical monster "Jew hatred"
in Grattenauer by mounting Pegasus. He addressed
the Jew-baiter with the scornful "thou."</p>

<blockquote>

<p>"Thou who hast grafted with so much success jurisprudence upon
theology, thou who didst lick salt in Halle&mdash;not indeed Attic salt&mdash;thou
who hast studied ignorance and stupidity under the great
Semler, if thou art so proud of thy Christianity, that with contempt
thou dost look down upon Jews, then pray let me ask thee why thy
prisons are crammed with criminals condemned upon charges of high
treason, murder, poisoning, robbery, and adultery? First remove
from thy midst the scaffold, the gallows, the rack, the scourge, and
all the ghastly instruments of torture and death, not one of which was
invented by Jews. Divest thyself of the demon, and then wilt thou
pity a people condemned to engage in traffic against its will, and
accused because it does traffic. Deceit is said to be a widespread
vice among Jews. Thy Christian tailor robs thee, thy bootmaker
gives thee bad leather, thy grocer false measure and weight, thy baker
despite prosperous harvests undersized loaves. Thy wine is adulterated,
thy man-servant and thy maid-servant combine to cheat thee.
Thou thyself&mdash;in the innocence of thy heart&mdash;offerest for sale wretched
lies and spiteful malice written upon blotting-paper, for six farthings,
which are not worth six pins, and thou darest assert that fraud is
peculiar to Jews. See whether among all the bankruptcies now
occurring in London and Paris there is a single Jewish failure."
"Thou dost foolishly repeat the silly prattle of the great Fichte, when
thou dost remark that the Jews constitute a state within the state.
Thou canst not forgive the Jews the crime of speaking correct
German, of dressing more respectably, and often judging more
justly than thou. They no longer wear beards, which thou canst<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_472" id="Page_472">472</a></span>
pull; they no longer speak gibberish, which thou mightest mimic....
The Jew for over twenty years has striven to approach
the Christian, but how has he been received? How many alterations
has he made in his canonical laws to be able to join you;
but from pure humanity ye turn your backs upon him.... Yet
thy pamphlet appears to me to be a good omen. The average man
believes that winter can be parted from summer only by terrible
thunder and hail-storms. Thus is it with thee. Persecution, fanaticism,
and superstition are at their last gasp, and by mighty raging
make their final effort through thee, before their spirit becomes
entirely quenched."</p></blockquote>

<p>The self-confidence manifested by Lefrank was
the surest sign of the ultimate victory of the Jews.</p>

<p>Under existing conditions, in view of the fact that
the Jews were apt to underrate and despise their
own power, the hope of emancipation was deceptive.
In Protestant as well as in Catholic countries, in
Prussia as well as in Austria, the people were even
more blindly opposed to them than their princes.
That an Austrian voice might not be wanting in the
chorus of Jew-baiters, a German-Austrian official,
named Joseph Rohrer (1804), wrote against the
"Jew people." He drew a dreadful picture, especially
of the Jews of Galicia, without hinting that the
Galician peasants were in a still lower state, and
that the nobility was more degenerate than either
class. Paalzow, Grattenauer, Buchholz, Rohrer, and
their allies succeeded in their design. The idea of
the emancipation of the Jews in Germany could not
yet be entertained. With all his zeal, Breidenbach
could not effect the abolition of the capitation-tax in
all places. It still remained in force, a sad reminder
and disgrace, in certain German provinces. Cannon
had to be brought into the field to destroy these
putrefying, deeply implanted prejudices.</p>

<p>A ray of light from the sun of freedom shining on
the Jews of France penetrated even to Russia.
The heart of Emperor Alexander I was filled with
mercy towards the numberless Jews dwelling in his
kingdom. He appointed a commission to consider
a proposal for improving their condition. But a<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_473" id="Page_473">473</a></span>
Russian commission takes time over its work, and
after two years' careful consideration of the interests
of Christians, and of the most effectual way of
benefiting the Israelites, an ukase was at length
published in 1804. By this law, farmers, manufacturers,
artisans, those who had acquired a university
education, or who had visited the upper or lower
schools, were exempt from the exceptional laws
against Jews. To wean them from using the jargon,
special privileges were granted to those who would
learn one of three languages&mdash;Russian, Polish, or
German. The culture of the Jews within his kingdom
was desired by Alexander, who hoped that
another Mendelssohn would spring from their
midst. Attendance at schools was not enforced; it
therefore depended on the Jewish community to
support boys' schools (Chedarim) as best they could.
Nor could it be otherwise amongst the millions of
serfs in Russia, not one of whom was permitted to
visit a school.</p>

<p>A limitation was, however, introduced at that
time which nullified all privileges in favor of the
Jews. Those who dwelt in the country were ordered
to depart within a short space of time and crowd
together in the cities. Cruel subtlety dictated this
order. The Polish landowners, who from indolence
had given over the care of their breweries and the
sale of produce to industrious and trustworthy
Jewish managers and farmers, were ruined by the
removal of the Jews from the villages, and thus
rendered incapable of revolt. This law could not
be carried out for the time being, but remained in
existence as a dead letter, until later days. The
worst result was that the Jews were treated as
strangers, although they had been more than half
a century in the Polish provinces. Naturally they
did not advance in culture, being hindered and persecuted
by Rabbinism, and even more so by Neo-Chassidism.</p>

<p class="center b2">1806&ndash;1813 <span class="smcap smaller">C. E.</span></p>

<p>Since the days of the Romans, the world had not
witnessed such sudden changes and catastrophes
as in the beginning of this century, when a new
Empire was founded with the intention of establishing
a universal monarchy. All the powers bent even
lower before Napoleon, Emperor of the French,
than before the First Consul Bonaparte. The pope,
who in his heart cursed him and the whole new
order, did not hesitate to anoint him successor to
Charlemagne. The German princes were the first
to recognize cringingly this innovation, the elevation
of an upstart over themselves. As if Napoleon by
contact with the Germans during his wars against
Austria and Prussia had become infected with their
Jew-hatred, his feelings with reference to them from
that time underwent a change. Although he had
before shown admiration for the venerable antiquity
and gigantic struggles of the Jewish race, he now
displayed a positive dislike to them. His unfavorable
attitude towards the Jews was used by the
Germans in Alsace to induce him to deprive the
French Jews of their privileges and reduce them to
their former state of abasement.</p>

<p>The storms of the Revolution had put an end to
the old accusations against the Jews of Alsace.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_475" id="Page_475">475</a></span>
Jewish creditors, usurers, Christian debtors were
alike impoverished by the Reign of Terror; the
olden times were swept away. When quiet was
restored, many Jews, who through their energy had
acquired some property again, went back to their
former trades. What else could they do? To
commence to learn handicrafts and agriculture could
not be expected of men advanced in years. Even
young men found it difficult, as bigoted Christian
employers in the German-speaking provinces did
not care to take Jewish apprentices. A numerous
class of the populace of Alsace offered well-to-do
Jews a source of income. The peasants and day-laborers,
before the Revolution serfs, had been
liberated through it, but possessed no means wherewith
to purchase land and commence work. Their
cattle and even their implements of agriculture were
lost during the stormy years; and many of them
had fled to escape military service. These peasants,
on the return of peace, had addressed themselves
to Jews for advances of money, to obtain small
parcels of the national land for cultivation.</p>

<p>The Jewish men of substance had responded, and
probably demanded high rates of interest. The
peasants, however, were not the losers, for, although
originally destitute of means, they had greatly
improved their condition. In a few years their possessions
in landed property amounted to 60 million
francs, the sixth part of which they owed to Jews.
It was, indeed, hard for the peasants of Alsace to
obtain ready money to discharge debts to their
Jewish creditors, especially as the wars of Bonaparte
called them away from the plough to bear arms, and
many lawsuits ensued against the debtors. The
Strasburg Trade Court of Justice alone, during the
years 1802&ndash;4, had to decide upon summonses for
debt between Jewish creditors and Christian debtors
amounting to 800,000 francs. The defaulting peasants
were sentenced to hand over their fields and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_476" id="Page_476">476</a></span>
vineyards to the Jewish creditors, some of whom
may have acted harshly in these matters.</p>

<p>These circumstances were made use of by the
Jew-haters. They generalized the misdeeds of the
Jews, exaggerated the sufferings of the Christian
debtors forced to pay, and stamped the Jews as
usurers and bloodsuckers, so as to deprive the
French Jews living in their provinces of their recently-acquired
equalization, or if possible to prepare some
worse fate for them. As at all times, the citizens of
the German town of Strasburg took the most prominent
part in this movement against the Jews. They
had made a vain attempt to keep the Jews out of
their city and to persecute them during the Reign of
Terror. With fierce rage they beheld the number
of Jewish immigrants increase. There were no
Jewish usurers in their midst; on the contrary, there
were wealthy, highly respected, and educated Jews,
such as the families of Cerf Berr, Ratisbonne, and
Picard, most of whom lived from their estates.
Nevertheless the people of Strasburg raised the
loudest clamors against the Jews, as if the latter
were the cause of their impoverishment. The prefect
of Strasburg, a German, aided and abetted the
merchants. When Napoleon stayed in Strasburg
(January, 1806), after the campaign of a hundred
days against Austria, he was besieged by the prefect
and a deputation of the people of Alsace with
complaints showing how harmful to the state were
the Jews; how like a crowd of ravens they ruined
the Christian populace, so that whole villages passed
into the possession of Jewish usurers, how half the
estates of Alsace were mortgaged to Jewish creditors,
and other malicious charges. Napoleon thereupon
called to mind that during his campaign some Jews
near Ulm had bought stolen articles from the
soldiers, which had greatly displeased him. The
Jew-haters suggested that these may have been
Strasburg Jews, who followed in the track of the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_477" id="Page_477">477</a></span>
army in order to enrich themselves by means of the
booty; and that all Jews were usurers, hawkers, and
ragmen. To incite the emperor still more to acts
of hostility, the following grave statement was
added&mdash;that, in the whole of Alsace, indeed, in all
the (German) Departments of the Upper and Lower
Rhine, the people were so embittered against the
Jews that a general massacre, scenes such as were
witnessed in the Middle Ages, might ensue. In
taprooms the question of slaughtering the Jews
was often discussed. His mind filled with such evil
impressions, Napoleon left Strasburg, promising
redress of these grievances. That this impression
might not fade away, the enemies of the Jews
besieged the minister of justice with loud complaints
about the baseness and hurtfulness of the Jews.
Judges, prefects, all German-speaking officials vied
with each other in attempts to deprive the Jews of
their civil rights. The minister of justice, carried
away by the complaints, was actually on the point of
putting an exceptional law into force against the
Jews of France, forbidding them for a time to do any
business in mortgages.</p>

<p>Mingled with this Jew-hatred, which arose from
the petty jealousy of guild members, and from fear
of excessive competition, were the bigoted and
gloomy views of the reactionary party, who commenced
to spin their network of schemes in order
to suppress mental freedom, the mother, so to speak,
of political liberty. One of the chief representatives
of this party, hostile to liberty, and skilled in intrigues,
was Louis Gabriel Ambroise Bonald, a man
of kindred spirit to Gentz, Adam M√ºller, and others
of like caliber, who, together with the romanticist
Chateaubriand, and Fontanes, a past-master of
flattery, brought about the most terrible religious
and political reaction. Bonald, who, after short-lived
enthusiasm for liberty, unfurled the flag of the
Bourbon Legitimists, and glorified it with mystical-<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_478" id="Page_478">478</a></span>Catholic
inanities, beheld in the liberation of the
Jews a diminution of the power of the Church, and
employed means to undermine their equalization in
France. He wished to lower them to the level of
such despicable beings as the Church required for
its purposes. In a paper which he issued conjointly
with Chateaubriand for the purpose of maintaining
the Ultramontane power, he attacked the Jews with
sophistical eloquence. He envied the Germans
because, more reasonable and prudent than the
French, they had remitted only the capitation-tax, and
had otherwise kept the Jews in subjection. He
blamed the National Assembly for having conceded
all rights without considering that when the French
Jews were released from the yoke, they might easily
act in concert with their co-religionists in other
countries to secure all influence and all wealth to
themselves and enslave the Christians. Bonald
again gave utterance to that venomous slander
which a venal, unscrupulous Alsatian had circulated
in a pamphlet before the Revolution. His recurring
statements were that the Jews were ever in conflict
with morality, that they formed a state within a
state, and that most of them were vampires and
petty traders, among whom the high-minded disappeared.
Bonald concluded his list of charges with
an opinion which stigmatized the French nation
as much as the Jews. "If the latter are ever
permitted to enjoy independence and frame laws,
then a Jewish Synhedrion would not establish more
nonsensical or unworthy laws than the Constituent
Assembly of philosophers has established."</p>

<p>It was a fortunate circumstance for the future of
the Jews that the enemies of freedom as well as
orthodox Christians included Jew-hatred in their
programme, because this impelled friends of liberty
to defend the cause of the Jews in part as their own.
But for the moment, Bonald's Jew-hating attempts
greatly harmed them. They were approved by<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_479" id="Page_479">479</a></span>
those who strove to retard the advancing spirit of
the age, and in a roundabout way were dinned into
the ear of Napoleon. The French Jews had no
idea of the extent of this agitation, they imagined
that it concerned only the Jewish usurers in Alsace,
and that it did not affect the honor, position, and
existence of all, and therefore they did not sufficiently
oppose it.</p>

<p>Matters now assumed a serious complexion.
Napoleon laid the Jewish question for discussion
before his council, which entrusted it to a young
member, a Count Mol√©, known in later French
history as the prototype of ambiguity. To the surprise
of all the elder and more influential members
of the council, Mol√©, whose great-grandmother was
a Jewess, presented a report decidedly hostile to
the Jews, suggesting that all French Jews be placed
under exceptional laws, which meant that their
legally acknowledged and practically realized equality
was to be taken from them. His report was
received with deserved derision by the oldest
members of the council, who were so imbued with
the principle of absolute equality sanctified by the
Revolution, that they could not conceive that a
creditor suing for payment from his debtor could
have a right to inquire into his religious belief.
They suspected that Mol√© was in league with the
reactionary politicians Fontanes and Bonald, who
were anxious to offer up the Jews as the first sacrifice
to their retrograde policy. Mol√©, however,
appears to have sought to curry favor with the
emperor, who, as he knew, was not kindly disposed
towards the Jews. Although all the councilors
were in favor of their unabridged civil rights, the
Jewish question was to be brought up at the regular
session of the state council under the presidency of
Napoleon (April 30, 1806), who attached great
importance to the matter.</p>

<p>It was a fateful moment when these questions,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_480" id="Page_480">480</a></span>
settled long ago, again came up for discussion.
The weal and woe not alone of the French and
Italian Jews, but of those in all Europe, depended
upon the issue of this consultation. For if the
equalization of the Jews of the former countries was
in any way threatened, those of other countries
would be doomed to remain in a state of degradation
and oppression for a long time to come. The
sitting was stormy. It happened unfortunately that
a recently elected state councilor named Beugnot,
who in the absence of the emperor had spoken
with great spirit and address in favor of the Jews,
wished to display his eloquence before the emperor.
He therefore made use of the following unlucky
phrase: "To deprive the Jews of their full civil
rights were like a battle lost on the field of justice."
Napoleon was annoyed. Both the tone and matter
of Beugnot's speech sorely displeased him. It
vexed him that his prejudices against the Jews
should be regarded as unfounded. Beugnot aroused
his passion, he spoke against theorists and propounders
of principles, and allowed his anger to
outrun his discretion. He spoke of the Jews as
Fichte had done, saying that they constituted a
state within a state, being the feudal nobles of the
time; that they could not be placed in the same
category with Catholics and Protestants, because,
besides not being citizens of the country, they were
a dangerous element. The keys of France, Alsace
and Strasburg, should not be allowed to fall into
the hands of a nation of spies. It would be prudent
to suffer only 50,000 Jews in the districts of the
Upper and Lower Rhine, to scatter the remainder
throughout France, and prohibit them from engaging
in trade, because they corrupted it by usury.
He made other accusations which he had learnt
from the Jew-haters. In spite of this speech, two
councilors of importance, Regnault and S√©gur,
ventured to speak on behalf of the Jews, or of justice.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_481" id="Page_481">481</a></span>
They pointed out that the Jews in Bordeaux,
Marseilles, and the Italian cities belonging to France,
like those in Holland, were held in the highest
esteem, and that the offenses charged against the
Jews of Alsace should not be imputed to Judaism,
but rather to their unhappy condition. They succeeded
in mollifying Napoleon's wrath for the
moment, and a second session decided the matter.</p>

<p>Meantime some influential persons succeeded in
impressing Napoleon with a better opinion of the
Jews. They called to his attention how quickly
they had become proficient in the arts and sciences,
in agriculture and handicrafts. Persons were pointed
out to him who had been decorated with the Order
of the Legion of Honor, or who had received pensions
for courage in war, and that, therefore, it was
slander to call all Jews usurers and hawkers. At
the second sitting of the state council (May 7, 1806)
Napoleon spoke in a milder tone of the Jews. He
rejected the proposal made to him to expel Jewish
peddlers, and endow the tribunals of justice with
unlimited authority over usurers. He desired to do
nothing that might be disapproved by posterity, or
darken his fame. Nevertheless, he could not free
himself from the prejudice that the Jewish people,
from the most ancient times, even from the days of
Moses, had been usurers and extortioners. He was,
however, determined not to permit any persecution
or neglect of the Jews. He then conceived the
happy thought&mdash;or it may have been suggested to
him&mdash;to bring together a number of Jews from various
provinces, who were to tell him whether Judaism
demanded of its adherents hatred and oppression
of Christians. The Jews themselves, through the
medium of their representatives, were to decide
their fate.</p>

<p>The decree which announced this resolution (May
30, 1806) was couched in harsh terms. Napoleon
himself, it appears, gave it the last touches whilst in<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_482" id="Page_482">482</a></span>
an angry mood. The first part of the decree ran
as follows: "The claims of Jewish creditors in
certain provinces may not be collected within the
space of a year." The second part ordered the
assembly of Jewish notables. The reason for their
meeting was such as to satisfy the Bonalds. Certain
Jews in the northern districts having by usury
brought misery upon many peasants, the emperor
had deprived them of civil equality. But he had
also considered it necessary to awaken in all who
professed the Jewish religion in France a feeling of
civic morality, which, owing to their debasement, had
become almost extinct amongst them. For this
purpose Jewish notables were to express their
wishes and suggest means whereby skilled work
and useful occupations would become general among
Jews. Thus, for a time at least, a portion of the
Jews of France were deprived of their rights of
equality. But balm might be expected from the
Assembly of Notables for the wounds inflicted by
Napoleon. The prefects were required to select
prominent persons from among the rabbis and the
laity, who, on a fixed day, should present themselves
"in the good city of Paris." Not only the congregations
of the old French provinces, but also those
in the new ones, in the district on the left bank of
the Rhine, were to be represented by deputies.
The Italian Jews, who applied for permission to take
part in this meeting, were likewise admitted.</p>

<p>Although the notables were somewhat arbitrarily
chosen by the magistrates, on the whole their selections
were fortunate. Among the hundred and
more notables of French, German, and Italian
speech, the majority were fully aware of the magnitude
and importance of their task. They had to
defend Judaism before the eyes of all Europe&mdash;a
difficult but grateful task. Among them were men
who had already gained fame, such as Berr Isaac
Berr, his promising son, Michael Berr (who had<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_483" id="Page_483">483</a></span>
issued the summons to princes and nations, to
release the Jews from bondage), and Abraham Furtado,
the partisan of the Girondists, who had suffered
for his political opinions, and was a man of
noble mind and great foresight. His descent is
interesting. His parents were Marranos in Portugal,
but in spite of the family's outward adherence
to the Church during two hundred years, his mother
had not forgotten her origin and her attachment to
Judaism. When the terrible earthquake made
Lisbon a heap of ruins, Furtado's parents were
overwhelmed by their falling house&mdash;his father
killed, but his mother, who was with child, entombed
in a living grave. She vowed that if God would
save her from this danger, she would, in spite of all
difficulties, openly embrace Judaism. A fresh shock
opened her tomb. She succeeded in escaping from
this place of horror, made her way to London, and
there publicly returned to Judaism. Here her son
Abraham was born, whom she brought up as a Jew.
Abraham Furtado was well acquainted with Jewish
literature; he collected materials for a Jewish history,
and paid particular attention to the Book of
Job; but his Jewish knowledge was mere dilettanteism,
without thoroughness. His favorite study
was natural science. During the Revolution, Furtado
belonged to the commission appointed to make
proposals for ameliorating the condition of the
French Jews. During the Reign of Terror, and as
a supporter of the Girondists, his life was endangered
and his property confiscated. By assiduous
industry he had enabled himself to purchase an
estate in Bordeaux. Next to the elder and younger
Berrs, Furtado was the brightest ornament of the
assembly; he was an eloquent speaker, and possessed
great tact in public affairs.</p>

<p>A happy choice was that of Rabbi Joseph
David Sinzheim, of Strasburg (born 1745, died
1812). He was a man of almost patriarchal character,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_484" id="Page_484">484</a></span>
of the deepest moral earnestness, and of a
most lovable, gentle nature. Well furnished with
means, and the brother-in-law of the wealthy Cerf
Berr, Sinzheim devoted himself to the study of the
Talmud, not from any mercenary purpose, but from
inclination. His acquaintance with Talmudical and
Rabbinical literature was astounding, but he was
lacking in depth. His education prevented his
being interested in other branches of science, but
at least he had no antipathy to them. During the
Reign of Terror, which caused the Jews in Jew-hating
Strasburg to suffer severely, he was compelled
to flee for safety, and could not return until
peace was restored. The number of the Jews in
Strasburg increased under the Directory and
Napoleon. They formed themselves into a congregation,
appointing Sinzheim as their first rabbi.
Thence he was summoned to Paris to attend the
Assembly of Notables. He was considered the
most eminent French Talmudist, and became the
leader of the orthodox party. Besides Sinzheim,
only one rabbi was prominent, the Portuguese
Rabbi Abraham Andrade, from Saint-Esprit; the
majority of the members were laymen.</p>

<p>With trembling hearts about a hundred Jewish
Notables from the French and German departments
assembled. They had no plan, as they did not
know precisely what were the emperor's intentions.
A summons from the minister, addressed to each
member singly (July 23, 1806), enlightened them but
little. They learnt that in three days' time, on a
Sabbath, they were to hold a meeting in a hall of
the H√¥tel de Ville set apart for them. There the
assembly was to organize, and they were to answer
the questions which imperial commissioners would
lay before them. The purpose was to make useful
citizens of the Jews, bring their religious belief into
agreement with their duties as Frenchmen, refute
the charges made against them, and remedy the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_485" id="Page_485">485</a></span>
evils which they had occasioned. The selection of
Mol√© as imperial commissioner, together with Portalis
and Pasquier, who were to treat officially with
the Assembly, was not calculated to quiet their fears.
Mol√© had been the first to serve as a medium
for the spread of the anti-Jewish slanders of Bonald
and others. On the day before the opening of the
Assembly (July 25), there appeared in the official journal,
the "Moniteur," an account of the history of the
Jews from the return from Babylon till that time.
The French nation was thus to be acquainted with
the importance of the questions now to be submitted
to the Jews themselves. In rapid sequence the
following circumstances were depicted:&mdash;The
independence and the dependence of the Jewish
people, their victories and defeats; their persecution
during the Middle Ages and the protection they
found; their scattered condition and their massacres;
the accusations directed against them; their abasement
and oppression in different countries inflicted
by monarch after monarch, and by fluctuating opinions
and policies. Jewish history thus received, so
to speak, an official seal. That there were many
errors and false statements in this account was not
to be wondered at. At the command of the emperor,
the Jewish religion, or Judaism, was officially
expounded, with even greater display of ignorance.
Two points were particularly emphasized, viz., that
the religious and moral separation of the Jews from
the rest of the world, and the pursuit of usury to the
injury of members of other creeds, if not prescribed,
was at any rate tolerated by the Jewish law. "How
otherwise is the fact to be explained," it was
remarked at the conclusion of the official document,
"that those Jews who at the present time extort
high rates of interest, are most religious and follow
the laws of the Talmud most faithfully?" The
inference was to the last degree false. "Do we
not see that the Portuguese Jews, who do not sully<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_486" id="Page_486">486</a></span>
themselves with usury, are less strict in their adherence
to the Talmud? Had the distinguished Jews in
Germany, such as their famous Mendelssohn, great
reverence for the rabbis? Finally, are those men
among us who devote themselves to the sciences
orthodox Jews?" Thus Talmudical Judaism was
once again represented as a stumbling-block in the
way of the progress of the Jews, not, indeed, in that
spirit of hatred which prevailed in Germany; but it
was laid open to attack, and that, too, before a public,
so to say a European, tribunal.</p>

<p>On the same day that the Jews formed the topic
of conversation in Paris, the deputies assembled to
decide upon a question of conscience. The first official
meeting was to be held on Saturday, and the first
business was the election of a president and of
secretaries by means of written votes. It was
the first time that representatives of the French,
German, and Italian Jews came together, and the
contrasts and variations developed during the last
half century by the changes in the times, became
apparent,&mdash;all shades were represented, from the politician
Furtado, to the rabbis who had spent all their
lives in schools. They were expected to harmonize.
At first they could not understand each other, but
had to employ German and Italian interpreters.
Was the public activity of the Jewish deputies to commence
with the desecration of the Sabbath? Or
should they strictly adhere to the religious prohibition,
and thus give a handle to enemies of the Jews,
who asserted that Judaism was incompatible with
the exercise of civil functions? These serious
questions occupied the minds of the members.
The rabbis and the party of Berr Isaac Berr were of
opinion that the first sitting should be postponed to
another day, or at least that no election should take
place. The less critical party, the politicians, urged
that they prove to the emperor that Judaism can
subordinate itself to the law of the land; and the
debate grew very violent.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_487" id="Page_487">487</a></span>
Thus the first Jewish Parliament in Paris assembled
on a Sabbath, in a room of the H√¥tel
de Ville, decorated with appropriate emblems.
The deputies attended in full force, none were
absent; some of them intentionally came in carriages.
Some of the stricter members again tried to have
the first meeting postponed, but in vain. The
dread of Napoleon's authority terrified those who
as a rule paid scrupulous regard to religious ordinances.
Under the chairmanship of Rabbi Solomon
Lipmann, the oldest member, the election now proceeded.
The orthodox had provided themselves
with ballot tickets, but most of the others wrote
them out unabashed before the very eyes of the
rabbis, whilst a few had theirs written for them.
Only two men were qualified for the presidency,
Berr Isaac Berr and Furtado. The former was
supported by the orthodox party, the latter by the
politicians. Furtado obtained the majority of votes.
With parliamentary tact he presided over the meeting.
The deputies became fully conscious of the
grave responsibility resting upon them, and proved
themselves equal to their task. All were animated
by a strong desire for unanimity.</p>

<p>Even the German rabbis, who hitherto had been
buried in the seclusion of the academies amidst the
Talmud volumes, quickly adapted themselves to
the new circumstances and to parliamentary forms.
Certain deputies contributed to impress all present
with a feeling of concord. The speech of the deputy
Lipmann Cerf Berr had a remarkable effect, especially
the following <span class="locked">words:&mdash;</span></p>

<blockquote>

<p>"Let us forget our origin! Let us no longer speak of Jews of
Alsace, of Portugal, or of Germany. Though scattered over the face
of the globe, we are still one people worshiping the same God, and as
our law commands us, we are to obey the laws of the country where
we live."</p></blockquote>

<p>When the officer of the guard of honor furnished
for the meeting approached the newly-elected president<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_488" id="Page_488">488</a></span>
to receive his orders, and when at the departure
of the deputies, the guard greeted them with military
honors and beat of drums, they felt themselves
exalted, and their fear was turned to hope.</p>

<p>This joyful expectation revived their courage, and
enabled them to oppose the attacks of Jew-hating
writers. Meantime the whole body of deputies from
the kingdom of Italy arrived, and created a favorable
impression by their bearing. Amongst them the
spirit of the age manifested itself in difference of
religious views and opinions, although not so sharply
marked as among the French and German Jews.</p>

<p>The most distinguished among the Jewish-Italian
deputies was Abraham Vita di Cologna (born 1755,
died in Trieste, 1832). He was well versed both
in Rabbinical and scientific learning, of prepossessing
appearance, and an elegant speaker. While
rabbi of Mantua, he was elected a member of the
Parliament of the Italian kingdom. His Talmudical
and secular knowledge, however, was neither comprehensive
nor deep. Cologna was in favor of the new
tendency, which removed Judaism from its isolated
position to imbue it with European ideas; but both
the means and end were not clearly defined in his
mind, and he took no steps to carry out his wishes.
An elder member of the Italian notables, Joshua
Benzion Segre (born about 1720, died 1809), at once
owner of an estate, rabbi, and municipal councilor of
Vercelli, was also in favor of scientific studies, and
belonged to the advanced party. The follies of the
Kabbala still found many supporters among educated
Italian Jews, although its first opponents had come
from Italy. Benzion Segre was averse to the study,
while the Italian deputy Graziadio (Chanannel) Nepi,
rabbi and physician in Cinto (born 1760, died 1836),
was a firm believer in it. He was exceedingly well
read in Jewish literature, and compiled an alphabetical
register of the names of Jewish authors of
ancient and modern times.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_489" id="Page_489">489</a></span>
At the second sitting (July 29), the three imperial
commissioners solemnly propounded twelve questions,
which the Assembly were to answer conscientiously.
The chief points were, whether the French
Jews regarded France as their country, and Frenchmen
as their brothers; whether they considered
the laws of the state as binding upon them, and,
by way of deduction from these two points, the
incisive third question, "Can Jews legally intermarry
with Christians," and, lastly, whether usury
in the case of non-Jews is permitted or forbidden.
The remaining points referred to polygamy, divorce,
and the authority of the rabbis, and were of a subordinate
nature. Most of the members could not
listen to these queries without feeling pain that their
love of country and their attachment to France
should be called into question, notwithstanding that
Jews had attested their patriotism by shedding their
blood upon battlefields. From many sides rose a
cry at these questions, "Aye, unto death." The
address delivered by Mol√© on submitting these
twelve questions was cold and to some extent offensive.
Its contents were nearly as follows:&mdash;The
charges against various Jews had been proved.
The emperor was, however, not satisfied to check
the evil himself, but desired the assistance of the
deputies. They were to state the whole truth in
replying to the questions laid before them. The
emperor permitted full liberty of discussion, but
wished them to bear in mind that they were Frenchmen,
and would be relinquishing that honor unless
they showed themselves worthy of it. The assembly
now knew what was expected. They were brought
face to face with the alternative of renouncing their
equality or damaging Judaism.</p>

<p>Furtado, in his reply to the speech of the commissioner,
very cleverly turned the mistrust of the
emperor into a semblance of trust. He said that
the Jews welcomed the opportunity of answering<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_490" id="Page_490">490</a></span>
these questions, to lay bare all errors and put an end
to the prejudices entertained against them. The
speech which Berr Isaac Berr delivered at this
meeting was more sincere, more manly, and altogether
more fervent. Furtado represented the
Jews, but not Judaism; he caused it to be understood
that the Assembly should consider it a duty and
an honor to obey every hint of the emperor. Berr
gave dignified expression to the claims of Judaism.
The duty of replying to the questions was assigned
to a commission, which included, besides the president,
the secretary, and the auditors, the four most
eminent rabbis, Sinzheim, Andrade, di Cologna,
and Segre, and two learned laymen.</p>

<p>This commission handed over the chief part of their
work to Rabbi David Sinzheim, the most scholarly
and esteemed member of the assembly, who in a
very short time completed his task to the satisfaction
of his colleagues, of the imperial commissioners,
and eventually of the emperor (July 30 till August 3).
His report was submitted to the commissioners,
who reported it to the emperor before it was brought
up for public discussion. Napoleon was so pleased
with the behavior of the Assembly that he announced
his intention to grant an audience to all the members.
In fact, their parliamentary tact, as displayed in the
proceedings, filled him with such high regard towards
them that he partially overcame his prejudices
against the Jews. He had always pictured them as
ragmen and usurers, with cringing, bent forms, or as
sly, cunning flatterers lying in ambush for their prey;
and to his astonishment he beheld among the members
men of fine character, intelligence, and imposing
appearance. He thus acquired a better opinion of
the Jews. It must be admitted that the incense
offered him by the Assembly, as to a deity, did not
leave him unmoved. On the other hand, the serious
task placed before the Jewish deputies made them
greater, exalted them above the common level, idealized<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_491" id="Page_491">491</a></span>
them. Their harmonious work aroused
their enthusiasm, the orations intoxicated them, and
even the sober German members became infected.</p>

<p>At the third sitting (August 4), at the debate upon
the replies to the various questions, the deputies
were filled with self-confidence and the certainty of
victory. No difficulty was offered by the first two
questions&mdash;whether polygamy was allowed among
Jews, and whether the validity of a divorce granted
by the French law was acknowledged by their religious
and moral code. These were decided according
to the desire of the emperor without any injury to
Judaism. But the third question aroused painful
excitement, and revealed the opposition which had
divided the Jews since the time of Mendelssohn&mdash;"May
a Jewess marry a Christian, or a Christian
woman a Jew?" This question had given rise to
heated debates in the commission, how much more
in public assembly. Even the orthodox party felt
that to reply unconditionally in the negative would
be extremely perilous. The commission, however,
had already supplied a clever answer, and if it is
owing to Sinzheim's efforts, it redounds to his intellect
and tact. At the outset it was skillfully explained
that, according to the Bible, only marriages
with Canaanite nations were forbidden. Even by
the Talmud intermarriages were allowed, because
the nations of Europe were not considered idolaters.
The rabbis, to be sure, were opposed to such unions,
seeing that the usual ceremonies could not be performed.
They would refuse to bless such an union,
as the Catholic priests refused their assistance on
such occasions. This refusal, however, was of little
consequence, as civil marriages were recognized by
the state. At all events, the rabbis considered a
Jew or Jewess who had contracted a union of this
kind as a full co-religionist.</p>

<p>The remaining questions were settled without
any excitement in two sittings (August 7th and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_492" id="Page_492">492</a></span>
12th). The questions whether the Jews regarded
Frenchmen as their brothers, and France as their
country, were answered by the Assembly with a
loud, enthusiastic affirmative. They were able to
refer to the doctrines of Judaism, which in its three
phases&mdash;Biblical, Talmudical, and Rabbinical&mdash;had
always emphasized humanity and the brotherhood
of man. Only one point in the report of the commission
gave rise to a certain amount of friction,
viz., that which seemed to ascribe a kind of superiority
to the Portuguese Jews, as if through their
conduct they were held in higher esteem by
Christians than the German Jews. This clause was
therefore struck out.</p>

<p>In answering the two questions relative to usury,
the Assembly was able to demolish a deeply-rooted
prejudice and place Judaism in a favorable light.</p>

<p>The commissioner Mol√©, the first to yield to Jew-hatred
and propose to exclude Jews from state
offices, had now to declare publicly (September 18)
that the emperor was satisfied with the intentions
and zeal of the assembly. His speech on this
occasion struck quite a different note to former
ones. "Who, indeed," he exclaimed, "would not
be astonished at the sight of this assembly of
enlightened men, selected from among the descendants
of the most ancient of nations? If an individual
of past centuries could come to life, and if this
scene met his gaze, would he not think himself
transplanted within the walls of the Holy City? or
might he not imagine that a thorough revolution
in the affairs of man had taken place?" "His
Majesty," continued Mol√©, "guarantees to you the
free practice of your religion and the full enjoyment
of your political rights; but in exchange for these
valuable privileges, he demands a religious surety
that you will completely realize the principles
expressed in your answers."</p>

<p>What could the surety be? Napoleon then<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_493" id="Page_493">493</a></span>
announced a surprising message, which filled the
assembly with joyful astonishment and electrified
them. "The emperor proposes to call together the
great Synhedrion!" This part of their national
government, which had perished together with the
Temple, and which alone had been endowed with
authority in Israel, was now to be revived for the
purpose of transforming the answers of the Assembly
into decisions, which should command the highest
respect, equally with those of the Talmud, with
Jews of all countries and throughout all centuries.
Further, the Assembly was to make known the
meeting of the great Synhedrion to all the synagogues
in Europe, so that they send to Paris deputies
capable of advising the government with intelligence,
and worthy of belonging to this assembly.
That the revived Synhedrion might possess the
honorable and imposing character of its model, it
was to be constituted on the pattern of the former
one; it was to consist of seventy-one members,
and have a president (Nasi), a vice-president (Ab-Beth-Din),
and a second vice-president (Chacham).
This announcement made the deputies feel as if the
ancient glory of Israel had suddenly risen from the
tomb and once more assumed a solid shape. Three
months previously they had been summoned to
rescue their civil rights which were endangered,
and now a new vista opened before them; they
seemed to behold their glorious past revived in the
present, and assisted in the accomplishment of the
dream; and they were filled with amazement.</p>

<p>Naturally, on receipt of this announcement, the
Assembly passed enthusiastic motions and votes of
thanks. They expressed their approval of everything
which the commissioners had proposed or
intimated. The Synhedrion was to be composed of
two-thirds rabbis and one-third laymen, and was to
include all the rabbis in the Assembly of Notables,
together with others to be afterwards elected. The<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_494" id="Page_494">494</a></span>
true importance of the Assembly now came to an
end; its duties now were merely perfunctory. The
proclamation issued to the whole Jewish world
(Tishri 24&mdash;October 6) was its only momentous
action thereafter. It aimed at rousing the Jews to
take an interest in the Synhedrion and to send
deputies. This proclamation was written in four
languages, Hebrew, French, German, and Italian,
and expressed the feelings which animated members
of the Assembly, and the hopes entertained for the
great Synhedrion:</p>

<blockquote>

<p>"A great event is about to take place, one which through a long
series of centuries our fathers, and even we in our own times, did not
expect to see, and which has now appeared before the eyes of the
astonished world. The 20th of October has been fixed as the date
for the opening of a Great Synhedrion in the capital of one of the
most powerful Christian nations, and under the protection of the
immortal Prince who rules over it. Paris will show the world a
remarkable scene, and this ever memorable event will open to the
dispersed remnants of the descendants of Abraham a period of deliverance
and prosperity."</p></blockquote>

<p>The Jewish Parliament, and the re-establishment
of a Synhedrion created much interest in Europe.
The world was accustomed to Napoleon's feats of
war and brilliant victories; the power of his arms
had ceased to astonish men. But that this admired
and terrible hero should descend to the most
ancient people, to raise and restore them to some
of their lost splendor, caused, perhaps, more general
surprise among Christians than among Jews. It
was looked upon as a miraculous event, as marking
a new era in the history of the world, in which a
different state of things would prevail. Some
Christian writers in Bamberg, at their head a Catholic
priest (Gley), expected such abundant and
important results from the Jewish assembly in Paris
that they established a special newspaper, a kind of
journal for the Jews. Only the Berlin <i>illuminati</i>&mdash;David
Friedl√§nder's circle&mdash;experienced an uncomfortable
sensation at the news, because they feared<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_495" id="Page_495">495</a></span>
that, through the Synhedrion in France, ancient
Judaism might be revived in a new garb. They
therefore declared the Synhedrion a juggler's performance,
provided by Napoleon for his Parisians.
Patriotism was also involved in this sense of uneasiness,
for the Prussian Jews participated in the deep
grief into which the people of Prussia and the royal
family had been plunged by the defeats at Jena and
Auerst√§dt (October 14, 1806).</p>

<p>Four days after the dissolution of the Assembly
of Notables (Adar 9&mdash;February 9, 1807), the Great
Synhedrion, very different in character, assembled.
It consisted, as mentioned above, for the greater
part of rabbis, most of whom had been members of
the Assembly of Notables. Twenty-five laymen
from the same Assembly were added, and the
ratification of the answers to the twelve questions
according to the wishes of Napoleon was secured.
To all appearances the great Synhedrion was to
assemble and transact business according to its
own pleasure. The commissioners were not to
have any communications with it. The minister
of the interior had chosen only the first three officials:
Sinzheim as President (Nasi), the grey-headed
Segre as first Vice-President (Ab-Beth-Din), and
Abraham di Cologna as second Vice-President
(Chacham).</p>

<p>After attending the synagogue, the Assembly
made its way to the H√¥tel de Ville, and there the
seventy members, in a hall specially decorated for
them, took their seats according to seniority, by
ancient custom in a semi-circle around the president.
The sittings were public, and many spectators
were present at them. The members of the
Synhedrion were suitably attired in black garments,
with silk capes and three-cornered hats. The
meeting was opened by a prayer specially composed
by Sinzheim. The speeches of Sinzheim
and Furtado, with which the first meeting commenced,
were entirely appropriate to the situation.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_496" id="Page_496">496</a></span>
The second sitting (February 12) was occupied
with the reading of the motions which the Synhedrion
was to sanction, together with the presentation
of addresses from different congregations in France,
Italy, and the Rhineland, and especially in Dresden
and Neuwied, expressing their agreement with the
assembly, and the reception of messengers to the
Synhedrion from Amsterdam.</p>

<p>The Synhedrion felt itself at a loss for subjects to
discuss. The new matters which they had proposed
to settle were left untouched. The Franco-Prussian
war had caused the emperor to be forgetful of
the Synhedrion and the Jews in general. There
only remained for the members of the Synhedrion
to convert the replies of the previous
assembly into definite, inviolable laws. The question
as to the power of the new Synhedrion to
impose binding laws, or whether it could be placed
on the same basis as the ancient one, was not debated.
The rabbis overcame this scruple by arguing
that each generation was permitted by the Talmud
to institute suitable ordinances and make new
decisions, and therefore, without further discussion,
they declared themselves as constituted. Without
demur, the Synhedrion adopted Furtado's disintegrating
view, that Judaism consisted of two wholly
distinct elements&mdash;the purely religious and the political-legislative
laws. The first mentioned are unalterable;
the latter, on the other hand, which have lost
their significance since the downfall of the Jewish
state, can be set aside. The inferences from this
difference, however, could not be drawn by any
individual, but only by an authorized assembly, a
great Synhedrion, which owing to unfavorable circumstances
had never been able to assemble. The
Synhedrion was, therefore, no innovation. The
following highly important paragraph with reference
to marriage was also passed without opposition:
That not only must the civil marriage precede the
religious ceremony, but that intermarriages between<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_497" id="Page_497">497</a></span>
Jews and Christians were to be considered binding,
and although they were not attended by any religious
forms, yet no religious interdict could be passed
upon them. In this evasive manner the Synhedrion
satisfied its own conscience and the suspicions of the
imperial officers.</p>

<p>As the Synhedrion had no actual business to
transact, the time of the sittings was filled up with
speeches delivered by Furtado, Hildesheimer, the
deputy from Frankfort, Asser, the deputy from
Amsterdam, and finally by Sinzheim, who made the
closing speech. The new decisions of the Synhedrion,
drawn up in French and Hebrew, enacted the
following: That it is prohibited for any Jew to
marry more than one wife; that divorce by the
Jewish law was effective only when preceded
by that of the civil authorities; and that a marriage
likewise must be considered a civil contract first;
that every Israelite was religiously bound to consider
his non-Jewish neighbors, who also recognize
and worship God as the Creator, as brothers; that
he should love his country, defend it, and undertake
military service, if called upon to do so; that Judaism
did not forbid any kind of handicraft and occupation,
and that, therefore, it was commendable for Israelites
to engage in agriculture, handicrafts, and the
arts, and to forsake trading; and finally, that it was
forbidden to Israelites to exact usury either from
Jew or Christian.</p>

<p>These new laws of the Synhedrion were of very
limited scope. The Synhedrion had in view only
the present, and did not look into the distant future.
The Jews in general were not satisfied with its
action and results. An English Jew, in a letter
addressed to the members, boldly reproached them
for having disowned, not alone Judaism, but all
revealed religion.</p>

<blockquote>

<p>"Has any one of our brethren in Constantinople, Aleppo, Bagdad,
Corfu, or one of our (English) communities been sent as a deputy to
you, or have they recorded their approval of your decisions?"</p></blockquote>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_498" id="Page_498">498</a></span>
The French Government, however, had obtained
the surety stipulated before the rights of citizenship
would be legally recognized anew. At the proposition
of the commissioners the Synhedrion dissolved,
and their resolutions were submitted to Napoleon,
whose attention had been fixed on the Prusso-Russian
war, until owing to the decisive battle of Prussian
Friedland the delusive peace of Tilsit was
concluded. During Napoleon's absence, plans were
secretly laid with the purpose of restricting the rights
of the French Jews. The Jewish deputies, however,
discovered this, and the indefatigable Furtado,
together with Maurice Levy of Nancy, hastened from
the Seine to the Niemen to acquaint the emperor
with the agitation against the Jews; and he remained
prepossessed in favor of Judaism.</p>

<p>After the dissolution of the Synhedrion the Assembly
of Notables again convened to present their
formal report to the authorities (March 25-April 6,
1807).</p>

<p>After an interval of a year, Napoleon announced
to the Jews his intentions with reference to legislation
on their behalf. He expressed (March 17,
1808) his approval of the wretched consistorial organization
which degraded the officials of the synagogue
to the level of policemen, and regulated the
civil position of the Jews, or rather made encroachments
on their hitherto favorable condition, although
he repeatedly assured them that their equalization
would suffer no restrictions. He had deceived all
the world, and everywhere trodden freedom under
foot; how could he be expected to keep his word
with the Jews and to leave their freedom unmolested?
The law suggests that the Jew-hating Mol√© framed
it. It contained no word about the equalization of
the Jews. No French Jew henceforth was to
engage in any species of trade without having
obtained the permission of the prefect, and his consent
was to be granted only on the testimony of the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_499" id="Page_499">499</a></span>
civil magistrates and the consistory as to the good
character of the applicant. Contracts of Jews
who could not show a patent were null and void.
The taking of pledges as security for a loan was
also surrounded by limitations which savored of the
Middle Ages. Further, no foreign Jew was to
settle in the German departments, nor any from
those departments in another district. Finally, the
Jewish people were not allowed to procure substitutes
for military service; each Jew who was chosen
as a soldier had to enter the ranks. These restrictive
laws were to remain in force for ten years, "in the
hope that by the end of that period, and by the
enforcement of various regulations, no difference
whatever would exist between the Jews and the
other citizens."</p>

<p>Thus the Jews of France, the anchor of hope of
their brethren in other countries, were once again
humiliated and placed under exceptional legislation.
The law enacted, indeed, that the Jews of Bordeaux
and certain other departments who had given no
cause for complaint should not be included under
these new restrictions. Shortly afterwards, owing
to their loud complaints, exceptions were made in
favor of the Jews of Paris, Livorno, the department
of the Lower Pyrenees, and of fifteen other districts
in France and Italy, so that only the scapegoats, the
German-speaking Jews in France, were deprived of
their civil rights. But the odious stain which had
been again fastened to the Jews adhered to the
emancipated as well. Their opponents, who zealously
strove to check the elevation of the Jews,
could now point to France, and urge that the race
was indeed incapable of amendment, seeing that even
where its members had been emancipated long since,
they had to be deprived of their rights of equality.</p>

<p>Napoleon's arm, powerful though it was, could
not stem the flood once set in motion, by the liberation
of oppressed nationalities and classes. By<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_500" id="Page_500">500</a></span>
his own genius and impetuosity he increased the
tumult of forces. After the subjection of Prussia,
Napoleon called into existence, chiefly at the
expense of this state, two new political creations,
the duchy of Warsaw (avoiding the dangerous and
magical title of kingdom of Poland), under the rule
of the Electoral Prince of Saxony, and the kingdom of
Westphalia under his brother Jerome (Hieronymus).</p>

<p>In the latter kingdom, formed from the territories
of many lords, the Jews obtained freedom and
equalization. Napoleon framed the constitution of
the new kingdom with the assistance of the statesmen
Beugnot, Johannes von M√ºller, and partially
also of Dohm, who, being friends of the Jews, had
made their emancipation a feature. Jerome, juster
and more honest than his brother, issued an edict
(January 12, 1808) declaring all Jews of his state
without exception to be full citizens, abolishing Jew-taxes
of every description, allowing foreign Jews to
reside in the country under the same protection as
that afforded to Christian immigrants, and threatening
with punishment the malicious who should
derisively call a Jewish citizen of his state "protection
Jew" (Schutz-Jude). Michael Berr, the brave
and pious defender of Judaism, was summoned from
France to accept office in the kingdom of Westphalia.
Jews and Christians alike were filled with
hope at this just treatment of German Jews, and
the Jew-hating German University of G√∂ttingen
elected Berr a member.</p>

<p>An important part was played at the new court
in Cassel by Israel Jacobson (born at Halberstadt,
1769; died at Berlin, 1828), who had been court
agent, or councilor of finance, at the court of Brunswick.
Although he cuts a figure in modern Jewish
history, and was pleased to consider himself a German
Furtado, yet he bore only external resemblance
to this earnest Jewish patriot. The similarity lay in
the fact that Jacobson possessed extraordinary flow<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_501" id="Page_501">501</a></span>
of language and great vigor in carrying out his projects,
which talents, it must be admitted, he
employed for ameliorating the condition of his co-religionists.
His wealth provided him with the means
of realizing, or attempting, all the schemes which
his active brain invented. Noble-minded, good-natured,
ready for any sacrifice, and energetic, he
kept one aim before him, the removal of the hateful,
repulsive exterior of the Jews and Judaism, and the
endeavor to render them externally attractive and
brilliant.</p>

<p>To commemorate the day of the emancipation of
the Jews, Jacobson caused a gold medal to be
struck with the emblem of the union of hitherto
antagonistic beliefs, and the Latin inscription: "To
God and the fatherly king, united in the kingdom
of Westphalia." At the instigation of Jacobson,
the Jews of the kingdom of Westphalia were to be
organized somewhat like their brethren in France.
Twenty-two notables were summoned to Cassel,
among whom the originator of the movement was
naturally included. Jerome received them kindly,
and spoke the memorable words on the occasion:
that he was pleased to find that the constitution of
his kingdom, which had been forced upon him, confirmed
the equality of all creeds, and in this respect
entirely corresponded with his own ideas. In the
commission appointed to draw up the plan for a
Jewish consistory in the kingdom of Westphalia,
Jacobson was naturally elected to the presidency.
Michael Berr was also a member. The constitution
of the consistory, on the model of the French,
was published at about the same time as the latter
(March 3, 1808). In France a rabbi occupied the
chief position, whilst in the German assembly
Jacobson was to be president. He desired to be
considered a rabbi, and even represented himself as
one. The chief meeting-place of the Westphalian
consistory was Cassel. Its authority was acknowledged<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_502" id="Page_502">502</a></span>
on many subjects, and Jacobson was all-powerful,
being ordered to consult the magistrates
only upon important occasions. The consistory
was also to be employed as a means of rousing patriotic
feelings in the hearts of old and young on
behalf of the House of Bonaparte. It especially
busied itself with the debts of the various congregations,
which were to be divided among the several
communities, and thus paid off easily.</p>

<p>Strange to say, one of the members of the consistory
was a Christian, state councilor Merkel, who,
acting as secretary, kept a watch upon the highest
Jewish judicial authorities like a detective. In the
French central consistory thoughtful, trusty men,
who had given proofs of their abilities, were elected,
such as David Sinzheim, the president, Abraham di
Cologna, and Menahem Deutz, whose son afterwards
obtained sad celebrity, men who knew how
to bridge over the gap between the old times and
the new; while Jacobson delighted in foolhardy
leaps, and dragged his colleagues along with him.
In transforming the condition of the congregations
and the synagogues under his jurisdiction, he consulted
with David Friedl√§nder, standing almost
within the pale of Christianity, and his colleagues
among the Measfim. The desire of Jacobson was
for reforms, or rather for the introduction of such
practices into the Jewish Divine service as were
observed in the Christian Church, especially such as
appealed to the senses.</p>

<p>The first German prince who voluntarily conceded
to the Jews at least a restricted amount of freedom
was Duke Charles of Baden, one of the dependents
of the family of Napoleon. Baden being on the
borders of France became accustomed to the recognition
of the Jews of the latter country as citizens;
and public opinion was more favorable to them
there than in other parts of Germany. To be sure,
the German Prince of Baden was not so free from<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_503" id="Page_503">503</a></span>
prejudice as the member of the Napoleon family
who occupied a German throne. He declared the
Jews citizens of the state, but did not give them the
freedom of the cities, so that they could not dwell
in such towns as had hitherto been closed to Jews;
and even where they had always been tolerated,
they were only to be regarded as "protected citizens."
The duke, however, reserved the right to
confer the freedom of the cities upon those who
should give up petty trading. Their religious peculiarities
were to be respected, "only in so far as they
agreed with the Mosaic Law, but not with the Talmudical
interpretations of the same."</p>

<p>Even the city of Frankfort for a moment succumbed
to the equality intoxication, although petty,
pedantic hatred of Jews was incorporated in every
patrician. This hatred had greatly increased in
intensity since the spread of revolutionary principles.
The subjection of the Jews was to compensate
for loss of independence. Not a single badge
or ceremony which perpetuated Jewish degradation
was removed from the Jews, who numbered about
five hundred families. The laws of "St√§ttigkeit,"
defining their dependent status, which had existed
for two hundred years, were still annually read in
the synagogue. Every newly admitted Jew was compelled
to take the oath of allegiance to the Senate.
Restrictions continued to be imposed on Jewish
marriages. Jew-taxes had to be paid, as if the
Holy Roman Empire still held sway, instead of the
all-powerful will of the Corsican, crushing emperors
and kings. The Jews were obliged to dwell in the
narrow, dirty, unhealthy Jewish quarter, and every
Christian, however degraded, had the right of calling
to the most refined Jew, "Mach Mores, Jud'!"
of treating him as a despicable object, and even
banishing him from the better parts of the city and
from the parks.</p>

<p>The French general Jourdan had indeed freed the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_504" id="Page_504">504</a></span>
Frankfort Jews from the Ghetto for a few years,
when he bombarded the city and destroyed that
portion of it. Under the eyes of the French victors,
the patricians, sorely against their will, permitted
Jews to rent houses in other districts; under no condition
could they purchase or erect houses. When
the Holy Roman Empire melted away like a snowflake
before the breath of Napoleon, when Frankfort
fell under the sovereignty of the Arch-Chancellor
or Prince Primate of the Rhenish Confederation, and
the powerful aldermen themselves became subject,
the serfdom of the Jews came to an end, though the
change was not expressed in legal enactments.
Karl von Dalberg, a liberal-minded man, and most
favorably disposed towards the Jews, would gladly
have removed their yoke, indeed he wrote to Gr√©goire,
the advocate of emancipation, upon this subject.
However, he was too well aware of the stubborn
hatred of the Frankfort patricians towards the
Jews, to venture upon their complete emancipation.
He had only promised in a general way at the
so-called coronation that the members of the Jewish
nation should be protected against injury and
insulting treatment. The urgent necessity of regulating
the status of the Jews by law, was apparent
to this Prince Primate, who discharged his duty only
by half measures, such as were characteristic of the
Germans. By the publication of a new order for
the government and protection of the Jews, he conceded,
in the spirit of the new era, that "previous laws,
being opposed to the modern constitution of the
Jewish nation," should be abrogated. At the same
time he figured as the adherent of the anti-Jewish
party by stating "that complete equality could not
be granted so long as the Jews did not show themselves
worthy of it, by forsaking their peculiarities
and adopting the customs of the country." By these
new ordinances they were treated as strangers on
sufferance, who might enjoy the benefits of the law of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_505" id="Page_505">505</a></span>
nations and of humanity, but not the rights of citizens.
The only relief measure was that the various protection-taxes
were consolidated into an annual
impost of 22,000 florins. Even the Ghetto was again
held out to them as their residence; they were
cautioned not to renew their leases in town with
Christian landlords, because the day would soon
dawn when they would have to return to their prison.
Naturally, the Jews of Frankfort used their utmost
endeavors to have these exceptional laws annulled,
the more as their co-religionists in the neighboring
kingdom of Westphalia were enjoying equality.
When the Rhenish Confederation was dissolved and
the Duchy of Frankfort created with a constitution
of its own, recognizing the equality of all inhabitants,
of whatever belief, Amschel, Gumprecht, and Rothschild
(the first court-agent who made princes subject
to himself), as representatives of the Jews, did not
rest until they had induced the Archduke Dalberg
and his council to establish their equalization by a
special law in spite of all opposition. The new archduke
being in want of funds, besides desiring the
freedom and equality of the Jews, consented to grant
these privileges for the sum of 440,000 florins (being
twenty times the amount of the annual tax of 22,000
florins), 150,000 to be paid at once, then 50,000, and
the remainder in annual payments of 10,000 florins.
The law (published December 28, 1811) decreed,
"that all Jews living in Frankfort under protection,
together with their children and descendants, should
enjoy civil rights and privileges equally with other
citizens." The Jews took the oath of citizenship,
entered upon their privileges and duties, and Louis
Baruch (B√∂rne), a Jew, was employed in the ducal
police. The Jew-street, or what remained of it, lost
its mournful privileges, and was swept out of existence
or joined to adjacent quarters. The proud
patricians gnashed their teeth at such unheard-of
innovations. They had suffered a double loss by<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_506" id="Page_506">506</a></span>
the abolition of serfdom and of the old laws regarding
the Jewish inhabitants; but for the time they had to
acquiesce.</p>

<p>The northern Hanse Towns, where German guild-narrowness
joined to ossified Lutheranism scarcely
allowed the Jews to breathe, were compelled by
order of the French garrison to grant them equality.
Hamburg agreed to place all its inhabitants, including
Jews, upon an equal level (1811), and also admitted
them to seats in the civic council. The following
testimony was afterwards adduced in their <span class="locked">favor&mdash;</span></p>

<blockquote>

<p>"With all the privileges of equality received, or guaranteed, their
much-feared presumption did not obtrude itself, nor had any disadvantages
accrued to the Christian citizens; on the contrary, the Jews
displayed a quiet, modest, and friendly demeanor in spite of additional
prerogatives, and showed eagerness to work for the public weal.
Several gained distinction by their great benevolence and patriotism."</p></blockquote>

<p>The small town of L√ºbeck showed more opposition
to the settlement and emancipation of a few Jews
under French protection. Hitherto only about ten
families were tolerated in the town as "protection
Jews," who were forbidden to engage in trade, join
the guilds, or obtain possession of houses. These
privileges were regarded as exclusively Christian;
no Jews dared claim them. Only three Jews were
allowed to come daily into L√ºbeck from the neighboring
town of Moisling (under the dominion of
Denmark or Holstein), and these were compelled
to pay a sort of poll-tax at the gate. Any deputy of
the merchants' guild could lay hands upon them,
and take them before the police, if they sold goods,
and everything found in the possession of such suspects
was confiscated. With the advent of the
French (1811&ndash;1814), about forty-two Jews from Moisling
and fourteen foreigners with their families
moved to L√ºbeck, thus bringing the number of
families in L√ºbeck up to sixty-six. These sixty-six
Jews aroused the fierce rage of the L√ºbeck patricians
even more than Napoleon's sovereignty. The
embargo laid by Napoleon upon the Continent to<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_507" id="Page_507">507</a></span>
annoy England had attracted several Jewish families
to North Germany, hitherto unfriendly to Jews.</p>

<p>In the Hanse Town of Bremen, which until then
had known only traveling Jews, who paid toll on
entering the town, Jews took up residence under
French protection, not indeed in great numbers,
but too many for the bigotry of the patricians. Here,
too, they were allowed equal rights with other citizens.
Even the Duke of Mecklenburg, Frederick
Franz, granted the equalization of the Jews (February
22, 1812), and allowed marriages between
Jews and Christians, a greater concession than those
made by any other code. Prussia also could no
longer resist the tide in favor of the Jews. In Prussia
they had displayed much greater love for their native
land, and brought more sacrifices during the times
of trouble than many of the corrupt nobility, who had
ingratiated themselves with their victorious enemies.
But a long time elapsed before King Frederick
William III could overcome his aristocratic and
religious repugnance to them. He only abolished
the insulting cognomen of "protection Jews," declaring
them not only admissible to the citizenship
of towns, but under compulsion to perform its duties.
They were forced to take the oath as citizens of towns
and to share in the burdens of the cities in which
they lived. But they were not to be recognized as
state citizens, their position being the reverse of that
of the Jews in Baden. The prospect of equalization
as state citizens was continually held out to them,
but the promise remained unfulfilled for several
years. When Hardenberg again assumed control of
the disturbed affairs of the state, and insisted upon
the repeal of decayed laws and the removal of rotten
conditions, he favored the removal of the civil disabilities
of the Jews, so that by their help new strength
should be infused into the mutilated, bleeding,
impoverished territory,&mdash;help which it could ill spare
in its wretched state of deep depression. David<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_508" id="Page_508">508</a></span>
Friedl√§nder and his friends, Berlin capitalists, used
their utmost efforts to bring about the state equalization
so long promised. The king again and again
delayed the ratification of the law submitted to him
by the chancellor. At length&mdash;moved, it is said, by
the interest taken by the Berlin Jews in commemorating
the death of the much-suffering, lamented
Queen Louise,&mdash;Frederick William gave his assent
(March 11, 1812) to the equalization of all Jews at
that time settled in Prussia. They were to be
admitted to posts in schools and colleges; but the
king withheld the privilege of admission to state
offices. With the privileges, they were to assume
the duties, especially as soldiers. Their religious
affairs were to be regulated afterwards: "When
the plan for their religious organization is drawn up,
such Jews as enjoy public confidence both on account
of their knowledge and probity will be consulted."</p>

<p>Three German princes alone withstood the spirit
of the age: those of Bavaria, Austria, and Saxony.
The first, Maximilian Joseph, appointed king of
Bavaria by Napoleon, promulgated an edict (June
10, 1813), which appeared to concede equality to
Jews, at least to those who possessed the right of
settlement. But it was equality with many limitations.
In cities to which no Jew had hitherto been
admitted, their settlement was to depend upon the
royal pleasure, and even in those places where they
had dwelt for a long time their numbers were not
to be increased, but rather diminished. In Austria,
Leopold II and Francis I, the successors of Emperor
Joseph, who had somewhat loosened the chains of
the Jews, left the favorable intentions of their predecessor
unexecuted, and imposed new humiliations.
In addition to the unendurable burden of taxes in
Bohemia, Moravia, Silesia, and Galicia,&mdash;taxes upon
candles, upon wine, and meat&mdash;a collection-tax was
imposed in Vienna, which was a toll upon every
Jew who entered the capital. Spies closely watched<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_509" id="Page_509">509</a></span>
the Jew who stayed in Vienna for a short time
unprovided with a passport, and treated him like a
criminal. Marriages among Jews were still restricted,
and could be contracted only by the eldest son
of the family, or by one able to pay heavy bribes.
Although Austria was so often overrun by the
soldiers of liberty, yet, impenetrable as the wall of
China, it resisted every innovation. In the newly-created
kingdom of Saxony all the restrictions
imposed in the time of the Electoral princes and
the Lutheran Church were maintained in their
fullest rigor. Saxony was rightly called the Protestant
Spain of the Jews. Indeed they were not
suffered to dwell in the country at all; only a few
privileged Jews were admitted to the two towns of
Dresden and Leipsic, but under the express condition
that they could be expelled at any time. They
were not allowed to have a synagogue, but only to
meet for prayer in small rooms, on condition that
they made no noise. In Leipsic and Dresden
every privileged Jew was compelled to pay annually
seventy thalers for himself, besides other sums for
his wife, children, and servants. The Jews were
rigidly constrained in their choice of trades and
occupations, and were placed under strict supervision
while traveling. When all other German districts
had abolished the poll-tax, Saxony still
retained it. The example of the two neighboring
countries&mdash;Westphalia and Prussia&mdash;had no influence
upon this district, which at that time was
rendered doubly selfish by trade jealousy and religious
prejudice. The reactionary movement found
plenty of fuel in Germany.</p>

<p>Like the Persian monarch Xerxes, Napoleon, hitherto
invincible, and grown haughty and brutal
through his successes, summoned the nations and
princes to a universal war, and they followed him
as submissively as slaves follow their master.
Proudly he led forth Europe, subdued by him,
against Asiatic Russia. Within the memory of
man such an immense expedition had not been
known. But, if ever, the words of the text were
fulfilled in this gigantic contest: "An horse is a
vain thing for safety, neither shall he deliver any by
his great strength"; if ever, Divine justice manifested
itself in him who had trampled upon right
and liberty. Napoleon was defeated, not by the
power of his enemy, but by a Higher Hand which
struck him with blindness&mdash;a blindness which permitted
the glow of the flames at Moscow and the
ice of a Russian winter to work his ruin. When
God and fortune had forsaken him, the princes who
had promised him service and allegiance fell away
from him, and turned the points of their swords
against him, and the people, which, relying upon his
own warlike talents, he had so greatly despised,
rose up against him. But the nations likewise were
stricken with blindness; whilst breaking asunder<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_511" id="Page_511">511</a></span>
one sort of bonds, they forged new ones for themselves.
The two years (May, 1812-April, 1814)
form an instructive chapter in history, from the
moment when Napoleon led an army of more than
half a million men against Russia, until the day
when, abandoned by all, he was compelled to flee,
in order to escape the threats and insults of the
embittered French people. It was a sanguinary,
horrifying drama.</p>

<p>No one could have suspected that the greater
would drag down the less in its ruin, that by the
downfall of Napoleon, the Jews whom he had liberated,
though reluctantly, would be hurled into their
former slavery. Jewish youths belonging to wealthy
families had emulated their Christian friends in
courage, and rushed to battle to help in slaying the
giant. Large numbers of Jews, especially in Prussia,
animated by burning love of country, had joined
the volunteers, had rejoiced to be accepted in the
ranks, and wipe away with their blood on the battlefield
the stain of cowardice, so often imputed to
them by the opponents to their emancipation.
Jewish young men paid for the freedom accorded
them on paper with their lives. Jewish physicians
and surgeons sacrificed themselves in the camps
and hospitals in their devoted attendance on the
wounded and the plague-stricken. Jewish women
and girls spared no efforts to bring help and comfort
to the wounded. Again, as in the days of
national independence, sons of the same race and
religion were opposed to each other&mdash;German Jews
engaged in deadly combat with French, Italian, and
Dutch Jews, and recognized each other only in the
last hour, in time to embrace as brothers. Those
unfit to bear arms had shown their attachment to
Germany and their worthiness of emancipation by
sacrifices in other ways. Nevertheless, the seemingly
forgotten Jew-hatred was rekindled in the
hearts of the Germans, extended ever further, and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_512" id="Page_512">512</a></span>
robbed the Jews of the reward which the hard-won
victories had promised to bring even to them.</p>

<p>With the fall of the hero began the rule of petty,
intriguing, reckless speculators, who bartered both
men and lands. They misled the princes who earnestly
desired to restore long banished freedom,
and ensnared them with lying artifices. In France
these intriguers, the Talleyrands, reinstated the
throne of the Bourbons. In Germany Metternich
and Gentz turned the struggles for freedom into
mockery. Only the more far-sighted knew that
Europe, owing to the closer connection between the
rulers, would be reduced to a more degrading state
of slavery, because sloth and pettiness were the
order of the day.</p>

<p>The Jews felt the first effects of the reaction now
commencing in Germany. It arose in Frankfort,
the seat of unmitigated, medi√¶val anti-Semitism.
As soon as the artillery of the retreating enemy
had ceased within the precincts of this city, loud
voices were heard encouraging each other to
demand that boundaries be set at once to the
unheard-of presumption of the Jews. In L√ºbeck
and Bremen, the citizens did not content themselves
with depriving the Jews of their recently-acquired
rights, but energetically strove to banish
them altogether. The proposal was seriously made
to drive all adherents of the Mosaic religion from
the town. In Hanover, Hildesheim, Brunswick,
and Hesse, they were at one blow divested of their
rights of equality. These events naturally gave
great anxiety to the Jews throughout Germany. If
the privileges granted them by law, as in Frankfort,
could be abolished, what security had they for the
continuance of their equality? What a contrast
this reaction presented to that in France! Here,
although the nobility, who hated freedom and were
thirsting for revenge, and the Catholic clergy were
in power at the court of Louis XVIII, and looked<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_513" id="Page_513">513</a></span>
upon the terrible events since 1789 as if they had
not happened, yet the rights of the Jews were not
abridged.</p>

<p>The Jews, concerned about their freedom, honor,
nay, their very existence, especially in the so-called
free towns, looked hopefully forward to the Congress
of Vienna, which was to readjust dismembered
Europe. The monarchical and diplomatic members
of the Congress, however, did not hasten to act the
part of Providence assigned to them. They opened
the meetings in November instead of in August,
and from the bosom of this Congress, intended to
establish eternal peace, a desolating war arose.
The community of Frankfort had sent two deputies
to Vienna, one of them Jacob Baruch, the father of
B√∂rne, chosen because he had patrons at the Viennese
court. Baruch fulfilled his task in a disinterested
manner worthy of his great son. Together
with his less known colleague, he presented a memorial
(October, 1814) to the Congress, wherein the
arguments in favor of the claim of the Frankfort
Jews were clearly set forth. They made the formal
claim, that their equalization had been duly purchased
for a large sum, and the patriotic claim, that they
had taken part in the liberation of Germany. Their
chief aim was to remove the suzerainty of the
Senate over them.</p>

<p>The Jews of the three Hanse Towns sent a
Christian lawyer as deputy, to guard their interests
in Vienna, who of his own accord had drawn
up an appeal for the equalization of the Jews. In
combination with the deputies, certain influential
personages worked quietly and unobtrusively. The
banking-house of Rothschild by its circumspection
and fortunate enterprises had made itself a power
in the money world; and not even prying suspicion
could find a trace of dishonesty in the accumulation
of its riches, which might be used as a pretext by
anti-Jewish opponents. The founder of the house,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_514" id="Page_514">514</a></span>
Mayer Amschel Rothschild, was held in the highest
esteem in Frankfort, and in consequence of the
equalization had a seat in the Electoral College.
Happily he died before the beginning of the reaction
(September, 1812), but his five sons increased the
wealth left by their father. Although they appear
to have adhered to the principle, not to throw the
power of their riches into the scale on behalf of their
co-religionists and their faith, yet they could not be
indifferent to the attempt made in Frankfort, their
home, to reduce the Jews again to a state of serfdom.
One of the brothers probably addressed words of
remonstrance to the most influential German members
of the Congress against diminishing the rights
of his co-religionists.</p>

<p>The statesmen who controlled German affairs in
the Congress showed themselves favorable to the
Jews. Hardenberg and Metternich in a letter on
the subject expressed their disapproval of the
oppressions to which the Jews in the Hanse Towns
were subjected (January, 1815), and advised the
Senate&mdash;advice which amounted to a command&mdash;to
treat them in a humane, just spirit. Hardenberg
pointed out to the Hanse Towns the example of
Prussia and the edict of March 11, 1812, and
remarked, with some sarcasm, that they would succeed
in depriving the Jewish houses of the prosperity
to which they had attained, and that constant
oppression would compel them to withdraw their
capital. In the sketch of the constitution for Germany
drawn up by the Prussian plenipotentiary,
William von Humboldt, which was submitted to
Metternich, and accepted as a basis for discussion,
the Jews were promised equality, even though they
were mentioned separately. "The three Christian
religious sects enjoy equal rights in all German
states, and the adherents of the Jewish faith, so long
as they undertake all the duties of citizenship, are to
enjoy corresponding rights." But the goodwill of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_515" id="Page_515">515</a></span>
the two chancellors, even though their sentiments
had been shared by the monarchs whom they represented,
did not suffice at that time. A new enemy
rose up against the Jews, tougher and more dangerous
than envy and bourgeois pride. This terrible
enemy who now turned his arms against the Jews
was the German visionary. The yoke so long
imposed on the Germans by the French, the compulsion
under which they had been to obliterate their
most characteristic peculiarities, had rendered hateful
to them, not alone everything French, but all that
was foreign, that did not bear the stamp of pure
German origin. Allowances should certainly be
made for a nation which, arriving at a consciousness
of its strength and solidarity, breaks its fetters, if it
conceives an exaggerated notion of its importance.
But it was unpardonable and childish that grown
men should dream in broad daylight, representing
their dreams as truth and trying to foist them upon
others. Extravagant Teutomania was a dream of this
kind, and resulted in the ruin of the Germans. For
the first time the German nation had acted as a unit;
hitherto it had been the tool of princes in Italian
expeditions, Turkish wars, or civil strife. The Germans
sought analogous cases in their own history
by which to regulate their conduct, and found them
only in the Middle Ages, in the time of the Empire
and the omnipotence of the papacy, or in early
Teutonic times when uncouth barbarism and childish
simplicity prevailed. The romantic school, the
Schlegels, Arnims, and Brentanos, had shown them
this grewsome specter of the Middle Ages in so
wonderful a light, that the Germans in their delusion
considered it an ideal, the realization of which was a
holy task. To the Middle Ages belonged Christianity,
credulity, unthinking clericalism, which became
the dearest possessions of the Germans, because
they were diametrically opposed to the unbelief of
the French and the revolutionary epoch. From<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_516" id="Page_516">516</a></span>
that time the hollow phrase, Christian-German
(or Teutsch), arose, and speedily became a catchword.</p>

<p>But only the devoted followers of Catholicism,
with the papacy as supreme authority, could be pious
in the sense of the Middle Ages. Honest romanticists,
such as G√∂rres, Frederick Schlegel, Adam
M√ºller, etc., logically went over to the Roman
Church, and helped to re-establish the empire of
the Jesuits and the Inquisition. As for the German
Protestants, "God had poured out upon them the
spirit of confusion and they tottered like drunken
men." Instead of directing their attention to Vienna,
where the Congress, amidst dancing and revelry,
was running its quarry, the German people, to earth,
the romanticists built castles in the air, and at once
announced that certain people would be denied
admission.</p>

<p>Christian Teutomania was the armed specter
which for many decades robbed the German Jews
of rest, honor, and joy in life. Because this race,
strongly marked by descent and tradition, was distinguished
from the Germans by external marks,
by features, carriage, and vivacity, although akin
in language, feeling, and temperament, they were repelled
as foreigners, as a force breeding disturbance
and discomfort, and had the spirit of the times permitted
they would have been expelled from German
territory. But to find a reason for this blind hate,
the enemies of the Jews had recourse to old contemptible
publications, and extracted rubbish from
sources where others had found the rich intellectual
treasures of the Jews, and drew such a portrait of
them as to arouse terror both in themselves and
others.</p>

<p>The first to clothe vague prejudice in words and
heap abuse upon the Jews was not a knavish writer,
but an academical professor named Friedrich R√ºhs,
whom the newly-founded Berlin University had appointed
to the chair of history. He wished to investigate<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_517" id="Page_517">517</a></span>
the decline of Germany, and hit upon the Jews,
as though they had been the authors of Germany's
disgrace during its occupation by foreign powers.
R√ºhs discussed the "Claims of the Jews to German
Citizenship," developed the unwholesome theory of a
Christian state, and thence derived his justification,
if not actually to expel the Jews from Germany, yet
to humble them and thwart their growth. He drew
up a complete programme for their treatment, which
was afterwards conscientiously carried out.</p>

<p>Above all things he wanted the Jews to live merely
on sufferance, and on no account to claim equal
rights of citizenship. They were once more to pay
protection-money, a Jew-tax, and limits were to be
set to their increase. The cities which had hitherto
not tolerated them were to be supported in this
course, and naturally Jews were not to be admitted
to any office, nor even permitted to defend their
country. R√ºhs, moreover, insisted that the Jews
should again wear a badge, not a repulsive yellow
patch, but a "national cockade"; at any rate some
mark of distinction, "that the German who could
not recognize his Hebrew enemy by face, gait, or
speech, might do so by the doubtful badge of honor."
Above all things, R√ºhs exhorted the German states
and the German people to promote the conversion
of the Jews to Christianity; that was most important.
It was generally asserted, even in Christian quarters,
that only bad and abandoned men exchanged Judaism
for Christianity; but that was prejudice.</p>

<p>R√ºhs' pamphlet excited great interest. Worthy
and learned men declared their agreement with him.
The learned German world at the time of Lessing,
Abt, Kant, and Herder, the apostolic messenger
of universal humanity, now talked the language
of the Church Fathers, and stirred up hate and
persecution. Schleiermacher and Fichte brought
the representatives of German intellect so low that
they actually competed with the ultra-Catholics in<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_518" id="Page_518">518</a></span>
hatred of the Jews. Pius VII, who in consequence
of the Restoration once more reigned in the Papal
States, and reintroduced the Inquisition, in order to
drive out godlessness by means of the auto-da-f√©,
ordained that the Jews should forfeit the freedom
enjoyed under French rule. The Jews of Rome had
to forsake their beautiful houses in all parts of the
city and return to the dirty, unhealthy Ghetto; the
Middle Ages had returned to the Papal States. The
Jews, as in the seventeenth century, had to attend
sermons for their own conversion on pain of punishment.
Meantime history had enacted one of those
surprising interludes, which was to prove the instability
of the reactionary Restoration. Napoleon had
contrived to land on French ground despite English
sea-guardianship. The props of the Bourbon throne&mdash;the
nobility, the clergy, and intriguers, who had
ostentatiously displayed their power,&mdash;collapsed
before a single shot had been fired, and Napoleon
entered Paris in triumph. The empire of the hundred
days was established. The whole of Europe armed
itself against one man, and the fortune of war decided
in favor of the allies on the Dutch battlefields at
Waterloo. In the Prussian army, which next to the
English had been most instrumental in turning the
tide of victory, there were many Jewish soldiers,
among them several militia officers.</p>

<p>What reward did the German Jews receive for
their sincere devotion to their country? When the
Congress, alarmed by Napoleon's sudden reappearance,
ceased to dally and began to hold regular
sittings, the Act of Federation for the German
states, which despite their union were to be autonomous,
was brought up for consideration, and a
paragraph in it devoted to the Jews. Citizenship
was to be assured them, and in countries where
obstacles to this reform existed, they were to be
removed as far as possible. But this paragraph
was accepted only by Prussia and Austria; all the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_519" id="Page_519">519</a></span>
other members of the league, especially those from
the free towns, voted against it. To arrive at an
agreement, a colorless compromise was proposed:
"The Congress of the allies will consider how the
civil improvement of those professing the Jewish
faith in Germany is to be effected in the most harmonious
manner, and how in particular the enjoyment
of civil rights and participation in civil duties
may be secured to them. The rights already conceded
them in the several federated states will be
continued."</p>

<p>The first portion was harmless, and could be
accepted by all, since it remained open to every
state to prevent its favorable interpretation. The
latter portion, however, was apt to put the Free
Towns into a delicate position. There the Jews
through French influence were actually in possession
of civil equality. Accordingly, the deputy for
Frankfort (the syndic Danz) emphatically protested,
and was supported by the Saxon deputies. To
shame German narrow-mindedness, the Danish
government, as if it had anticipated that the hatred
of Jews in Germany would spread, ordered Bernstorff,
its representative for Holstein, to declare
that the adherents of the Jewish faith, if they fulfilled
the duties of citizenship, might there expect a
constitutional provision ensuring them against
persecution, oppression, arbitrariness or uncertainty
of legislation in respect of the rights conceded to
them. The deputy for Bremen, Senator Schmidt,
was cleverer; he did not protest, but defeated the
suspicious resolution by a master-stroke. Remarking
that the privileges of the Jews conferred by the
French in North Germany (the 32d military division)
could not be binding on the Germans, he
stated that they need only change the word <i>in</i> into
<i>by</i>, and everything would be right. Nobody at first
took notice of this apparently insignificant change.
Metternich and Hardenberg, who hitherto either<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_520" id="Page_520">520</a></span>
from inclination or in pursuance of promises had
appeared to favor the Jews, passed over this point
in an incomprehensible manner. Thus the paragraph
referring to the Jewish question in its final
form read: "The rights already conceded the professors
of the Jewish faith <i>by</i> the several federated
states will be continued." Of the federated states,
however, only Prussia and Mecklenburg, and perhaps
also Baden, had conceded citizenship to the
Jews. The enactment of the French authorities
was thus made null and void, and Germany was
saved. What did it matter to the delighted nation
that this verbal change would cost so many tears?</p>

<p>The humiliation of the Jews soon showed itself in
practical life. L√ºbeck, protected by the unfair
interpretation of a paragraph, ordered more than
forty Jewish families to leave the town (September,
1815). Bremen did the same with its Jews. Frankfort
could not eject its Jewish inhabitants, but their
lives were embittered; they were shut out from
civil assemblies, Jewish functionaries were deposed,
they were excluded from many trades and industries,
marriage permits asked by Jewish couples
were refused with the heartlessness of the Middle
Ages, they were forbidden to live in certain parts
of the town, and were treated as though they were
still <i>servi camer√¶</i>. But as the Senate knew that
Prussia and Austria regarded it as a point of honor to
preserve intact the civil rights of the Jews of Frankfort,
and that the Federal Diet, at the instance of
both great powers, might easily determine the controversy
in favor of the Jews, it applied to three
German juridical faculties, those of Berlin, Marburg,
and Giessen, to have the question decided as one
of law.</p>

<p>This struggle between the Frankfort Senate and
the Jews, protracted during nine years (1815&ndash;24),
and occasioning many vexations, will ever remain a
stain on the time, a monument of German narrow-<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_521" id="Page_521">521</a></span>mindedness.
The Jews, relying on the assurance
of the two German powers, believed that their civil
rights were guarded as by a triple wall.</p>

<p>But just this manifest truth, the Teutomaniacs
and sophists, suddenly developed into bigots,
sought to obscure and cry down. From all parts
of Germany there resounded simultaneously outcries
against the Jews, urging the nation, or the
German federation, to enslave the Jews or destroy
them. Journals and pamphlets raged against them,
as if Germany or Christendom could be saved only
by the destruction of the Jews.</p>

<p>The most violent attack was that of a physician
and professor of natural science at Heidelberg, J.&nbsp;F. Fries, "Danger to the Welfare and Character of
the Germans through the Jews" (summer, 1816), in
which he asserted that the Jews ought to be
expelled the country, that the tribe must be exterminated
root and branch, as among all secret and
political societies they were most dangerous to the
state. "Ask man after man, and see, whether
every peasant and every burgher do not hate and
curse the Jews as national pests and bread robbers."
The Jews, he said, had contrived to get more than
half the entire capital of Frankfort into their hands.
"Let them go on for forty years, and the sons of the
first Christian houses will seek service among the
Jews in the meanest capacities." It is remarkable
that in the face of such passionate incitement, wild
outbreaks against the Jews did not occur at that
time, especially as Fries' pamphlet was read in all
taverns and public-houses.</p>

<p>Was no Christian voice raised against this injustice?
For the honor of the Germans it must be
mentioned that some men had the courage to contend
against crass prejudice and blind hatred. A
highly respected and learned councilor in Ratisbon,
August Kr√§mer, wrote a defense, "The Jews and
their Just Claims on the Christian States; a Contribution<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_522" id="Page_522">522</a></span>
to the Mitigation of the Cruel Prejudices
against the Jewish Nation." Councilor Schmidt, in
Hildburghausen, on the one hand, pictured the
abominable scenes which Christian fanaticism had
in the past enacted against Jews, and, on the other
hand, showed the superiority of culture possessed
by the latter over the Christians in Spain. But
their most thorough-going advocate was Johann
Ludwig Ewald, a reformed clergyman of Carlsruhe,
of high position, and seventy years old. R√ºhs' and
Fries' malignant statements about the Jews incensed
him so deeply, that he denied himself a season's
recreation in Baden, and employed the time in giving
the lie to their impudent assertions in a pamphlet
(1816). Ewald vindicated the downtrodden
sons of Israel in the name of Christianity, whose
representative he was. Every groundless complaint
against them he dissolved into nothing.
From England and France, too, admonitions
reached the Germans not to expose their own pettiness
by their insane hatred of the Jews. An
English paper thought that the town of L√ºbeck, as
well as all the free towns, ought to be deprived of
their independence (of which they had made so
infamous a use) by the German federation, on
account of the ignorant intolerance displayed
against the Jews. A French writer, M. Bail, vindicated
the unhappy people in glowing language, and
covered their German enemies with shame.</p>

<blockquote>

<p>"The Jewish nation to a higher degree than any other possesses
the ancient, sanctified character which excites astonishment. I never
meet a rabbi adorned with a white beard without thinking of the venerable
patriarchs. Nothing is more elevating about the Israelites
than their solemn life, which makes them the most devoted and honorable
people on earth. In their midst is to be found the illustration
of all domestic virtues, of loving care for the needy, and profound
reverence for parents. Happy, a thousand times happy, are the
nations among whom the basis of morality has been preserved."</p></blockquote>

<p>But if truth and justice had spoken with angels'
tongues, the Germans of those days would have<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_523" id="Page_523">523</a></span>
remained deaf to their voices. They were so
deeply imbued with hatred of the Jews that they
were irrational.</p>

<p>An organ of the Austrian government directed a
sort of threat against the encroachments of the
people of L√ºbeck upon the rights of the Jews.</p>

<blockquote>

<p>"How can the future Federal Diet discuss the improvement of the
condition of the Jews, if individual states anticipate it by the most
cruel and arbitrary resolutions? This conduct exhibits want of
respect as much towards the ensuing Federal Diet as towards the
foremost courts of Germany, whose principles in regard to this matter
have been often and loudly enough expressed."</p></blockquote>

<p>What was done by Austria itself, which displayed
such righteous indignation against L√ºbeck on
behalf of the Jews? Francis I and his ruler Metternich
completely forgot the benevolent intentions
of Joseph II, and kept in mind only the hateful laws
of Maria Theresa against the Jews. They did not
indeed expel the Jews, as in L√ºbeck and Bremen,
but they were relegated to Ghettos within Austria,
beyond which they were not allowed to pass.
Tyrol, the secluded mountain province, was closed
to them as to Protestants. In Bohemia the mountain
cities and villages were forbidden them, and in
Moravia, in the great cities of Br√ºnn and Olm√ºtz,
they were allowed to stay only over-night or for a
short time. Everywhere there were Jew-streets;
the restrictions imposed on the Jews of Austria had
become proverbial, whilst in Galicia they met with
greater oppression than in the Middle Ages. Even
the benevolent regulations of Joseph II, in regard to
compulsory school attendance and practical religious
instruction, were carried out not so much to
spread culture among the Jews as to torment and
injure them. Emperor Francis ennobled a few
Jews, but the others were humiliated; they were
obliged to render military service, but the bravest
were rarely admitted even to the lowest rungs of
the military ladder.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_524" id="Page_524">524</a></span>
Austria, to be sure, had made the Jews no promises,
and had awakened no hope of freedom. But Prussia,
where they had already enjoyed full citizenship, conjured
up a hobgoblin worthy of the Middle Ages,
and wounded their honor the more deeply. Frederick
William III, who had confirmed the equality of
the Prussian Jews by law, annulled it, or rather left
it unexecuted, a dead letter. Unconsciously he succumbed
to the theory of the Christian state set up
by the Teutomaniacs and sophists, who insisted that
no place of honor be conceded the Jews. The
promised equalization of the Jews in the newly-acquired
or reconquered provinces was continually
delayed. In the latter they remained subject to the
restrictions of a former time, and Prussia's legislation
regarding the Jews was a curious petrifaction. There
were twenty-one fundamental laws for their treatment,
and they were divided into French, old Prussian,
Saxon, and Polish Jews, naturally to their disadvantage.</p>

<p>The specific aim of Prussia was to make Jews
despicable in society. Whereas formerly the
government had been at pains to avoid in official
correspondence the words Jew, Jewish, as
having an offensive connotation, they were now
insisted upon.</p>

<p>The Jud√¶ophobist spirit in Prussia showed itself
in a case which challenges comparison with France.
The unjust Napoleonic law which had suspended
the equality of the Jews of the German departments
for ten years in respect of free migration and commerce
was to fall into abeyance after the end of the
respite (March 17, 1818), unless it was prolonged.
The government of Louis XVIII, although besieged
by clerical and political reactionaries, did not for a
moment make an attempt to preserve the limitation.
In the Chamber, which occupied itself with this point
(February and March, 1818), only one hostile voice
(Lathier) was raised against the Jews in Alsace. This<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_525" id="Page_525">525</a></span>
opponent of the Jews alleged that the whole country
would soon be in the hands of the Jews, if a check
was not put to their greed. Not even the Right,
which was clerically disposed, uttered a word against
the Jews in general and for the restriction of their
liberties. The phantom of a Christian state was
quite unknown to the French. The Chamber rejected
Lathier's proposal, and thus the Jews of Alsace were
restored to their former equality. A similar law
had been passed against the Jews of the district on the
left bank of the Rhine, which was added to Prussia,
or the Rhine province and Westphalia. The Prussian
government, on taking this former French
territory, had permitted the continuance of restrictive
legislation, and a cabinet order of March 3d, 1818,
renewed it for an indefinite period.</p>

<p>About this time a distinguished Englishman, with
the Old and New Testaments in his hand, advocated
the equality and freedom of the Jews throughout
Europe with extraordinary zeal. Lewis Way, a disciple
of the Fifth Monarchy enthusiasts of the English
War of Independence, accepted the prophecies of
the Old Testament and the Apocalypse, and was convinced
that the Jewish nation would be resurrected,
and be restored in glory to the land of their fathers.
Only when they had recovered their independence
would they be converted to the doctrines of Jesus.
It was therefore a matter of conscience with him to
promote the welfare of the Jews. He made a journey
to Poland to ascertain the number and condition
of the Jews in that country. Way now elaborated
a remarkable memorial in which he dwelt on the
high significance of the Jews in the past, and also in
the future. With this memorial he betook himself
to Aix, where the king of Prussia and the emperors
of Russia and Austria with their ministers and diplomatists
were met in Congress (end of September,
1818). He sought to make a favorable impression
on Emperor Alexander, whose mystical temperament<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_526" id="Page_526">526</a></span>
was known to him. As soon as the Czar
showed himself in favor of the equalization of the
Jews, it could not be doubted that Frederick William
III and Emperor Francis would also be well disposed
towards it.</p>

<p>Way started with the supposition that the Jews
were a royal nation, and had not ceased to be so
even in exile, in the misfortunes of their tragical
career. This people possessed the key to the history
of the whole globe. The same divine grace which
had guided them in former times rested on them in
banishment and exile. The promises which the
prophets had foretold for the Israelite race would
not fail to be accomplished; they would once more
be gathered together in the land of their fathers.
All the nations of the earth which have received
salvation through them, were bound by gratitude to
show the Jews the greatest honors and boundless
beneficence, so as to wipe out the guilt incurred against
this divinely-gifted race by the cruel persecutions inflicted
on them. The present moment was highly
favorable to their complete liberation. In some countries
fanatical, narrow-minded clamorers had raised
their voices against the emancipation of the Jews, but
they no more represented public opinion than the furious
outcries of a few American planters against the
suppression of slavery. If Way was an enthusiast,
when he tried to prove the necessity of emancipation
in a mystical manner from prophetic and apocalyptic
verses, he was still true enough to the practical
instincts of the English race to be able to prove to
their majesties what profit the emancipated Jews
would bring the state. He conceded that much
about the Jews must be altered, but their national
peculiarity was holy property, which must not be
touched. It was the invisible tie which bound the
past of the Jews with their future, the past of mankind
with its future; the fulfillment of prophecy
depended on Israel.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_527" id="Page_527">527</a></span>
This mystical, yet sensible memorial was handed
by Way to the Emperor of Russia, on whom it must
have made an impression, for he delivered it to his
plenipotentiaries, Nesselrode and Capo D'Istrias,
charging them to bring it and the emancipation of
the Jews under the notice of the Congress. Out of
respect for Alexander, who at that time pulled the
strings of European politics, the plenipotentiaries
were obliged to give attention to the matter, if only
in appearance. The protocol said (November 21,
1818) that, though they could not in every respect
accept the point of view of the writer of the memorial,
they must render justice to the tendency and
laudable aim of his conclusions. The plenipotentiaries
of Austria and Prussia (Metternich, Hardenberg,
and Bernstorff) declared themselves ready to
give any information with regard to the question in
both monarchies, which might aid in solving a problem
important to the statesman and the philanthropist;
but this was no more than a courtly phrase.
Another voice addressed enthusiastic words in favor
of the German and Polish Jews to the Congress at
Aix-la-Chapelle. Michael Berr, like his father, untiringly
active in the elevation of his co-religionists,
poured forth the stream of his oratory in their cause.</p>

<blockquote>

<p>"In Charlemagne's favorite city the monarchs will finally decide
concerning the political existence of my co-religionists in Germany.
The honor of Germany, the honor of the age and that of monarchs,
loudly demand the reinstatement of the Jews in their civil and political
rights. With justice are they exercised about laws, which still
exist here and there to the disadvantage of the Jews."</p></blockquote>

<p>The Italian Jews also combined to send a petition
to the Congress of Aix-la-Chapelle concerning
the abolition of their grievances and the cessation
of persecution. They lost nothing by failure to carry
out their design. The time had passed when princes
and statesmen, sages and citizens, interested themselves
in "the improvement of the condition of the
Israelites," as the phrase ran.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_528" id="Page_528">528</a></span>
The ill-feeling against the Jews in Germany continued
to grow without ground or provocation.
Jewish preachers celebrated the battle of Leipsic
(October 18, 1818) in the synagogue with great
enthusiasm, but to the Teutomaniacs this was no
proof of their patriotic love. The hatred against
Jews assumed so violent a character that a writer,
one not badly disposed, saw reason to foretell the
outbreak of popular attacks on life and property.</p>

<p>Germany was at that time intensely excited by
the murder of Kotzebue, in Mannheim, by a half-mad
Christian student, Karl Sand (March, 1819),
and by the harsh regulations of the government
against demagogic and Germanizing movements,
which it had formerly fostered. The Germanizers
panted for a sacrifice, and, as they could not attack
the statesmen, such as the Metternichs, Gentzes,
and Kamptzes, the helpless Jews were marked as
victims. A series of brutal outbreaks occurred
during several months. With the cry of "Hep,
hep!" against the Jews, the Middle Ages revived
again like a jeering ghost, and persecution was
galvanized into life by the student and commercial
classes.</p>

<p>The city of W√ºrzburg commenced the attack. A
new professor was inducted into office (August 2)
amidst the rejoicings of the students, who were
joined by a large number of people. Suddenly an
old professor, Brendel, was noticed, who had shortly
before written in favor of the Jews, for which it was
alleged that he had received a box of ducats. On
seeing him, there resounded from the mouths of the
students the insane cry, "Hep, hep!" together
with the outcry "Jude, verreck," <i>i. e.</i>, "Jew, die like
a beast." The former expression, then used for the
first time, meant in student's slang, "Jerusalem is
destroyed" (Hierosolyma est perdita). Brendel
was pursued, and had to flee for safety. Perfect fury
took possession of the people of W√ºrzburg, who<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_529" id="Page_529">529</a></span>
broke into the shops of the Jews, throwing the
goods into the streets, and when they defended
themselves with stones, the bitterness increased to
frenzy. A regular battle ensued, many wounds
were received, and several persons killed. About
forty citizens took part in the affray. The military
had to be called out, or the Jews would have been
massacred. The next day the burghers appealed
to the civic authorities to order the dismissal of the
Jews from W√ºrzburg, and to this they had to submit.
Overcome with grief, about four hundred
Jews of all ages left the town, and encamped for
several days in the villages or under tents, looking
forward to a terrible future. The persecution of the
Jews in W√ºrzburg was repeated in Bamberg, and
in almost every town of Franconia. Wherever a
Jew showed himself, he was assailed with the insulting
cry of "Hep, hep!" and ill-treated.</p>

<p>This persecution of the Jews in Franconia was a
hint to the Frankforters how to humble their hated
fellow-citizens, who had dared bring an action
against the Senate, and were protected by the
Federal Diet. Thus a riot was re-enacted here
(9th and 10th August), which began with the cry,
"Hep, hep!" and with the breaking of windows in
Jewish houses; then the mob advanced to brutality,
and drove away all Jews from the promenades with
insults and outrage. Artisans, workmen, shop
assistants, secretly encouraged by their employers,
as in the time of Vincent Fettmilch, two centuries
before, made violent attacks on Jewish houses.
The house of the Rothschilds in particular was
selected for attack, their wealth and political importance
being a thorn in the side of Christian patricians.
In Paris at this time, all the ambassadors
and diplomatic representatives appeared at a ball
given by James Rothschild, and in Germany the
Rothschilds were still treated as peddlers. Several
wealthy Jews left Frankfort after this outrage. The<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_530" id="Page_530">530</a></span>
storm, which became frenzy in Frankfort, the seat
of the Diet, was not an indifferent matter to the
ambassadors. The moneys of the Diet were placed
in Rothschild's coffers for security. The president,
Count von Buol Schauenstein, summoned a conference
of members, and it was resolved to call out
the federal troops, as the city militia could not be
trusted. The persecution of the Jews in Frankfort
aroused great attention throughout Europe, but the
excitement against them continued, in spite of the
arrival of the troops. Several Jews consequently
sold their houses, and even the Rothschilds put no
trust in the lull, and had serious thoughts of leaving
Frankfort; they would have had to emigrate to
France or England, as they were not safe anywhere
in Germany.</p>

<p>This massacre of the Jews spread like wildfire in
Germany, as if the people had everywhere waited
for a sign to break out. In Darmstadt and Bayreuth
the riots were repeated (August 12). The
few Jews in Meiningen were expelled. In Carlsruhe,
one morning, a placard was found posted on
the synagogue and the houses of prominent Jews&mdash;"Death
and destruction to the Jews!"</p>

<p>In D√ºsseldorf black marks and threatening placards
were found on the doors of several Jewish
houses. In the territory of Baden, where Sand had
sealed the Teutomaniac folly with a murder, and
the excitement still lasted, the bitterness against
the Jews was so great that not one could appear in
the streets without being maltreated. In Heidelberg
a tumult arose (beginning of September) in
consequence of a vulgar scene, which curiously illustrates
German chivalry. A citizen had outraged a
Jewish maiden, and had been arrested by the police.
Nearly the whole populace immediately rushed to
rescue the hero and destroy the Jewish houses.
Cries of "Hep, hep!" resounded in the streets;
axes, crowbars, tools of all sorts were collected as<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_531" id="Page_531">531</a></span>
if to carry a place by storm. The city guard, which
ought to have dispersed the assaulting party,
refused their services. The city governor, Pfizer,
instead of standing by the persecuted, assisted their
assailants. Blood would have been spilled, had not
the Heidelberg students, humanized, perhaps, by
contact with France, defended the unprotected
people at their own risk, under the leadership of
two professors, Daub and Thibaut. When at length
the armed force appeared, and patrols swept
through the whole province of Baden, and every
small town and village was made responsible for the
attacks of certain of their number upon the Jews,
the outbreaks against the Jews gradually subsided,
but the hatred against them was only intensified.</p>

<p>"From Germany the spark of Jew-hatred flew
even into the capital of the Danish state," which a
few years before had extended citizenship to the
Jews, and had refused to revoke it. In Copenhagen
the mob rose up (September), and commenced by
throwing stones at the Jews, and ended with acts
of violence. The government proclaimed martial
law. The citizens, in the few cities where Jews
lived, stood by them, and the preachers preached
tolerance and love to them from the pulpit. In
Germany the ministers of religion did not utter a
single protest during these outrageous scenes.
That no feature of the persecution of the Jews of
the Middle Ages might be wanting, a synagogue
was stormed in a small Bavarian place, and the
scrolls of the Law rudely torn to pieces. Even
where actual violence could not be resorted to, the
insulting cry of "Hep, hep!" was hurled at the
Jews in small and large towns, to the amusement
of the spectators. The police or military force
which appeared against the rioters and disturbers
secretly took part against the Jews, and the governments
which protected them did so more from
fear, because they suspected a demagogical movement<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_532" id="Page_532">532</a></span>
behind the outbreaks against the Jews. Reference
was afterwards made to these outrages, as
illustrating the feeling, or rather ill-feeling towards
the Jews, to withhold equal rights from them.</p>

<p>The zenith of Teutomaniac Jew hatred was
reached by the inflammatory pamphlet which
appeared at this time of excitement, "The Mirror
of the Jews" (November, 1819). Hartwig Hundt,
a man of adventurous life, boldly advocated the
slaughter of the Jews. He made most laudable
propositions, which, he flattered himself, would satisfy
the "Hep, hep" people.</p>

<blockquote>

<p>"Although I for my part hold the killing of Jews neither a sin nor
a crime, but only a police offence, I would nevertheless never counsel
that they be condemned and punished unheard, as seems to be the
fashion now."</p></blockquote>

<p class="in0">What then? His proposals <span class="locked">were:&mdash;</span></p>

<blockquote>

<p>"Let the children of Israel be sold to the English, who could
employ them in their Indian plantations instead of the blacks. That
they may not increase, the men should be emasculated, and their
wives and daughters be lodged in houses of shame. The best plan
would be to purge the land entirely of this vermin, either by exterminating
them, or as Pharaoh and the people of Meiningen, W√ºrzburg,
and Frankfort did, by driving them from the country."</p></blockquote>

<p class="in0">The "Hep, hep" storm and Hundt's murderous
lessons were the poisonous fruit of the seeds which
Fichte and Schleiermacher had sown, and which had
shot up quickly and abundantly.</p>

<p>Hundt's inflammatory book, in which every word
is an abomination, was as ravenously swallowed by
the German reading public, as his bad novels.
Only at the request of Jews it was forbidden and
confiscated by the censorship, which had become
omnipotent through the Carlsbad regulations. In
Portugal, at about the same time, a motion was
brought forward in the Cortes to re-admit the banished
Jews and atone for the crime perpetrated
against them, whilst in Germany authors and statesmen
justified this crime, and wished it to be repeated
in the nineteenth century. Hundt did not stand<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_533" id="Page_533">533</a></span>
alone in his advocacy of the extirpation of the Jews.
Who cares to enumerate all the virulent, hostile
writings against the Jews of the years of the "Hep,
hep" storm? Conversation on questions of the
day, however remote from the subject of the Jews,
always ended in abuse of them. If an author glorified
Sand and his murder of Kotzebue, and praised
his Christian religious spirit, he did not fail to add
that "Christian hate would call down a day of judgment
upon the Jews, the accomplices of financiers
who worked the ruin of the state, even though no
writer had ever printed a syllable to the disadvantage
of the Jews."</p>

<p>Thus every man's hand was against them; no
defender of any weight or influence appeared for
them, whose word, if it could not silence, might at
least curb the opposition. The aged Jean Paul
(Friedrich Richter) did not raise his voice for them,
although he had a predilection for the Jews; nor
Varnhagen von Ense, although Rachel was his wife,
and was included in the general obloquy. Only one
writer overcame his prejudice, and defied public
opinion in order to take up cudgels on behalf of the
universally despised and downtrodden Jews. This
was the comedy writer Julius von Voss, whose voice
certainly had no great weight, and whose disordered
affairs roused the suspicion that Jewish liberality
encouraged his venturesomeness. Voss himself in
his comedies and novels had exposed the Jews to
ridicule, but from regret and remorse, he confessed,
he desired to protect the Jews against the "Hep,
hep" insults. His words were little regarded, and
even were derided. Still less impression was created
by the anonymous writings of various freemasons in
favor of the Jews, but their goodwill should be recognized.
The converted Jews conducted themselves
at this juncture in a shameful manner. Not
one of them, except B√∂rne, came forward, in behalf
of their former brethren, with that just indignation<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_534" id="Page_534">534</a></span>
which violence against the defenseless ought to
inspire. Rachel von Varnhagen, it is true, wrote
to her brother, Ludwig Robert, who had been a
witness of the "Hep, hep" storm, in the following
<span class="locked">manner:&mdash;</span></p>

<blockquote>

<p>"I am intensely moved, as I have never yet been, on account of the
Jews. They are to be preserved, but only for torture, for contumely,
for insult, for brutal outrage. The hypocritical newborn love for the
Christian religion (God forgive me for my sin!), for the Middle Ages
with their art, poetry, and hideousness, incites the people to the only
abomination to which, mindful of all past experiences, it can still be
incited. It is not the action of the people, who are taught to cry
"Hep, hep." The professors Fries and R√ºhs, and others, such as
Arnim, Brentano, 'our connections,' and yet greater persons are
filled with prejudices."</p></blockquote>

<p class="in0">She thought that the Christian priests ought to step
forward to check the outrages of the people. "Aye,
the priests." But neither Rachel, nor her brother
Robert, nor her husband Varnhagen, who elaborated
their periods for every childish folly, and had a
voice in public opinion, raised it against violence,
and against the rule of oppression.</p>

<p>The Jews had, it is true, their own literary exponents
to protect them. In Germany alone there
were nearly forty Jewish writers who could address
the German public. They possessed two Jewish
organs, and the daily journals occasionally opened
their pages to them. They advanced boldly to the
battle-field to ward off the universal accusations
against their race. Even the aged David Friedl√§nder
raised his voice, wrung his hands over the
enemies of the Jews and their persecutions in Germany
in the nineteenth century, and could not conceive&mdash;he
who considered official Christianity and
the State as ideal&mdash;how these gods could wallow in
so much filth. He addressed himself to the Countess
Von der Recke, and reminded her of the time
when eminent Christians conversed pleasantly with
Jews, and both received instruction from each other.
This sounded like a forgotten fairy tale from
ancient days. But the Jewish combatants only<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_535" id="Page_535">535</a></span>
threw light missiles, and could scarcely prick the
thick hide of prejudice. For this purpose sharp and
heavy harpoons were necessary. At this point the
Guide of all history, who had not abandoned the
Jews, awakened for them two avenging angels, who
with fiery scourges lashed the perverseness of the
Germans. These avenging spirits, who brought
the Germans more blessings even than their guardian
angels, were Ludwig B√∂rne and Heinrich
Heine.</p>

<p class="center b2">1819&ndash;1830 <span class="smcap smaller">C. E.</span></p>

<p>Why should not B√∂rne and Heine have a page in
Jewish history? Not only did Jewish blood flow in
their veins, but they were imbued with true Jewish
spirit.</p>

<p>The lightning darts which they flashed across
Germany, now in the colors of the rainbow, again in
glaring sheets, were charged with the electricity of
Jewish Talmudism. Both B√∂rne and Heine renounced
Judaism, but only like combatants who, appropriating
the enemy's uniform and colors, can all the more
easily strike and annihilate him. Both expressed,
with a clearness which left nothing to be desired,
how much they cared for the religion of the cross,
which they professed. There is, therefore, not the
slightest reason why Christianity should count B√∂rne
and Heine as members of its flock on account of
the idle ceremony through which they passed in
church. One of them, in spite of his changing
moods, at heart remained truer to Judaism than the
Friedl√§nders who constituted themselves its representatives.
These two gifted individuals, the pride
of Germany, are still greater ornaments to Judaism.
To these two Jews, the Germans owe their pure
taste, their feeling for truth, and their impulse for
liberty&mdash;to these two Jews persecuted through life
by the abominable "Hep, hep." The mists of the
Middle Ages, with which the Germans artificially<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_537" id="Page_537">537</a></span>
surrounded themselves in order to obscure the truth,
were dispersed by the flashes of wit of B√∂rne and
Heine, and light in its purity was restored. They
grafted wit and life on German literature, and
banished that clumsiness and awkwardness which
had aroused the ridicule of the neighboring nations.</p>

<p>In their childish spite against the Jews, the Teutomaniacs,
the R√ºhses and Hundts, asserted that
Judaism could not produce a man of forcible character,
or gifted with a true sense of art. History at once
gave them the lie, and put them to shame. Judaism
furnished forth a vigorous apostle of liberty, with
language recalling that of the prophets and the
Roman Catos, who confounded all the ideas of the
Germans concerning law; and it supplied a poet,
with artistic sense characterized by a mixture of
pathos and cutting irony, who abolished all their
hard and fast rules of art. The rich, varied blossoms
of the B√∂rne-Heine mind sprang from Jewish soil,
and were only watered by European culture. Hence
the close connection between them in spite of their
dissimilarity and mutual antipathy. Not only was
their wit Jewish, but also their love of truth, their
aversion to vain display, their hatred of veiling and
palliating wrongs, their contempt for official pomp,
for obscuring clouds of incense, for ringing of bells,
ambrosial organ tones covering slavery, perversion
of justice, and oppression. The democratic,
freedom-loving spirit, noticeable in B√∂rne more than
in Heine, and the analytical, Spinoza-like mode of
reasoning, more characteristic of Heine than of
B√∂rne, are Jewish to the core. Had they been born
Christians, and brought up in the atmosphere of
red-tapeism, neither of them would have developed
as rescuing powers, which with laughing mien
helped to banish deeply-rooted perversions and
absurdities. The slaves became deliverers, and
saved their enemies from the double yoke of political
and social inferiority. The Teutomaniacs almost<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_538" id="Page_538">538</a></span>
deserve thanks for having tormented the Jews with
their reactionary measures. They roused, if not
Heine, certainly B√∂rne, who was inclined to idle speculation,
and furnished him with the dart that wounded
the enemy.</p>

<p>Ludwig B√∂rne, or L√∂b Baruch (born in Frankfort-on-the-Main,
1786; died in Paris, 1837), saw the light
in the same year when it was extinguished for Mendelssohn,
as though history wished to compensate
the bereaved Jews for the loss of the sage of Berlin.
B√∂rne resembled Mendelssohn in some respects:
in his timid, bashful, somewhat awkward bearing, in
his self-control, his strength of character, and his
strict adherence to an adopted system of morality.
Both became the objects of admiration by accident,
in spite of themselves. Both drew up for themselves
√¶sthetic rules of conduct without having been
trained to do so.</p>

<p>B√∂rne despised the Jews of his time, and spoke
of them as if he were their arch-enemy. Jewish
antiquity, misrepresented to him in his youth, and
still more dimmed by his Berlin and Halle friends,
he looked upon as a caricature. The ancient Jews
from the day of Abraham until the time of "wealthy
Solomon" appeared to him "as if they had wished
to parody history." He did not suspect how much
his inward self, the truthfulness of his nature, owed
to Judaism. The filth of Lucinde, consecrated by
Schleiermacher, so disgusted B√∂rne at the age of
sixteen, that even a stealthy perusal of the book
possessed no charm. The sobriety with which
Judaism had endowed him showed B√∂rne the right
way of balancing his ideal nature, and avoiding too
harsh a discord with the real world. At an early
age he became acquainted with a goddess to whom
he was devoted in extravagant love, and to whom
he remained faithful until his dying breath. "The
true nature of virtue may be expressed in a few
words. What is virtue? Virtue is bliss. And<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_539" id="Page_539">539</a></span>
bliss? It is liberty. We cannot further inquire, what
is liberty, for liberty is in accord with reason, in accord
with God, and in accord with the unconditional&mdash;it
explains itself." So thought B√∂rne, and so he wrote
in his diary at the age of eighteen; and this idea
governed his inner being as long as he lived, and
was the motive power of all his actions. Virtue is
liberty, and liberty is virtue; they necessitate and
produce bliss. Yet B√∂rne limited his love of liberty;
he guarded himself from overstepping that narrow
boundary at which the pursuit of an ideal turns to
madness.</p>

<p>May not his Jewish blood, or at any rate, the sad
pages of Jewish history, explain his worship of liberty,
which influenced his body and mind? How hard and
degrading the absence of liberty was could be felt
only by a Jew, in comparison with whom an Indian
or a Russian bondsman was a free man. Frankfort,
the birth-place of B√∂rne, with its disgraceful laws
concerning the residence of Jews, effectually taught
him love of liberty. When, only a boy, he was prohibited
from walking on the footpath, and had to
keep to the dusty road for vehicles, when every
ragged Christian beggar, or drunkard, was allowed
to call to him, "Mach Mores, Jud!" the thought may
have struck him that the absence of liberty was
damnation and the presence of liberty salvation.
"I, a slave from my birth, love liberty more than
you; yea, because I was trained in servitude, I understand
liberty better than you!" he often said. His
much admired style, his perfect, captivating manner,
his profound epigrams, recall the gnomic wisdom of
Bible and Talmud. In short, B√∂rne owes his favorable
points to Judaism. But he neither was grateful
for his gifts, nor did he acknowledge their origin,
which he estimated no more than did his Berlin
friends. On one occasion, indeed, he said:</p>

<blockquote>

<p>"I should not deserve to enjoy the light of the sun, were I, on
account of mockery upon which I have always looked with contempt,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_540" id="Page_540">540</a></span>
ungrateful for God's great favor, in having made me at once a
German and a Jew: for I know how to value the undeserved fortune
of being at the same time a German and a Jew, to be able to strive
after all the virtues of the Germans without participating in their
faults."</p></blockquote>

<p>He added, addressing the <span class="locked">Germans:&mdash;</span></p>

<blockquote>

<p>"I pray you, do not despise my Jews. If only you were as they are,
you were better. You have deprived the Jews of air, they have thus
been preserved from rottenness; you have strewn the salt of hatred
into their hearts, their hearts have thus been kept fresh. You
have imprisoned them for the whole long winter in a cellar, and
stopped up the cellar door with dung; but you, exposed to the frost,
were half frozen to death. When spring arrives, we shall see who
will blossom first, Jew or Christian."</p></blockquote>

<p>B√∂rne did not, however, himself believe in the
endurance of the Jews, and he gave utterance to
those words only because he was vexed, or in order
to vex the Germans. He said at the same time,
ironically: "You know how my heart beats for the
Jews."</p>

<p>Since the time when his mind began to mature,
he beheld in the Jews only money-makers, as on the
Exchange at Frankfort, or deriders of religion
ashamed of their race, as in the salon of Henrietta
Herz; moreover, his education had made Judaism
seem so despicable that he did not judge it worthy
of consideration. Thus B√∂rne never understood
what was most sacred to the Jews, and he was unable
to fathom the depths of his own mind, and discriminate
between what he owed to the general
state of culture and what to Judaism.</p>

<p>His healthy spirit, however, and love for the
oppressed guarded him from the unprincipled conduct
of Rachel, of those who frequented the salons
at Berlin, and of many others who turned their
backs contemptuously upon the Jews. Even as a
youth B√∂rne hated the idea that the word "Jew"
might be insultingly cast at him.</p>

<blockquote>

<p>"And when they come and tell you that you are a Jew," he wrote
in his diary, "how they bandy about the Jewish jargon, so that one
must almost die of laughter.</p></blockquote>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_541" id="Page_541">541</a></span></p>

<blockquote>

<p>"Oh! when I think of that, my mind is tossed as by a storm, my
soul would fain burst from its dwelling-place, and seek the body of a
lion, that it might meet the villain with jaw and claw."</p></blockquote>

<p class="in0">His anticipations proved correct, he was not spared
the insult, and his lion's claw was shown. While a
student, he procured from the police of Frankfort a
passport, in which the spiteful police-clerk had
inserted the words: "Jew of Frankfort."</p>

<blockquote>

<p>"My blood stood still, but I could neither say nor do anything, for
my father was present. I then swore in my heart: only wait, the
time will come when I shall write a passport for you, a passport for
all of you."</p></blockquote>

<p>For a moment it seemed as if B√∂rne would forget
his oath. The Jews of Frankfort had bought equality
for half a million of money, and B√∂rne, who had
studied law and shown himself a young man of
promise, was one of the first to receive a position in
the Frankfort police department. But if B√∂rne was
inclined to forget that he was a Jew, and remembered
only that he was a German, the people of
Frankfort did not forget it, and imprudently and
brutally reminded him of his secret oath. He was
the first victim of the reaction; he was expelled
from office, as soon as the Jews of Frankfort were
driven back into the Ghetto. The insolent manner
in which they were cheated out of trebly pledged
freedom revolted B√∂rne's feeling for liberty, and he
sharpened his first arrows in defense of the members
of his own race. They were directed against
the narrow-minded citizens of Frankfort, who in the
nineteenth century had restored the laws of 1616
concerning the residence of the Jews, "that romance
of malice," as B√∂rne called them. The feelings
which agitated him during the years of ever-increasing
reaction against the Jews he put into the mouth
of a Jewish officer in a novel:</p>

<blockquote>

<p>"You stole from me the pleasures of childhood, you arrant knaves!
You threw salt into the sweet cup of my youth, you placed malicious
slander and hateful derision in my road in manhood; arrest me you<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_542" id="Page_542">542</a></span>
could not, but fatigued, vexed, without joyfulness, I reached my
goal.... That I cannot even revenge myself, that I should not
have the power to forgive, nor the weakness to chastise! They are
out of my reach in their fox-hole!... You ask me why I shun
my fatherland. I have none; I have never left my home. My home
is in dungeons; where there is persecution I breathe the atmosphere
of my childhood. The moon is as near to me as is Germany."</p></blockquote>

<p>Instead of revenging himself for the wounds
inflicted upon him and the members of his race by
German Jew-hatred, B√∂rne undertook the difficult
task of extinguishing this hatred. In the "Waage,"
his organ, he erected ideal standards, by which he
measured the narrow, petty circumstances of the
Germans, and their short-sightedness.</p>

<p>Before Louis Baruch undertook his campaign
against German faults and prejudices, or rather
before he undertook the education of the Germans,
he renounced Judaism, was baptized in Offenbach,
and assumed the name Karl Ludwig B√∂rne (June 5,
1818). How little he cared for the Christian faith
we may judge from his remark that he "repented
the money spent on baptism." He did not wish
the effect of his missiles to be lessened by the prejudice
which might arise from the fact of their being
discharged by a Jew. It is, however, difficult to
excuse a man of B√∂rne's character for deserting,
without any such struggle as Heine's with himself,
the colors of the weak and oppressed, who should
have been ennobled in his eyes by the very pain of
degradation; deserting for a cause, moreover, in which
he did not believe. Germany soon discovered that
she had gained an author of Lessing's caliber. B√∂rne's
wit was felt the more keenly, because at every turn
one could perceive the correctness of the picture
and observe the genuineness and integrity of the
painter. A glance revealed that he wrote with "the
blood of his heart and the sap of his nerves," hence
his words made the impression of weighty deeds.</p>

<p>He could not behold in silence the folly and
cruelty of the "Hep, hep" year, and he wrote "for<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_543" id="Page_543">543</a></span>
the Jews." "I should have said for right and liberty;
but if these terms were understood, nothing
need be said." He pointed his finger at fools, and
threw light on the faces of villains. "A sort of
fatal necessity," he said, "was connected in past
times with Jew-massacres. They seem to have
arisen from an indistinct, inexplicable feeling
inspired by Judaism, which, like a scoffing and
threatening spirit, like the ghost of a murdered
mother, accompanied Christianity from its cradle."
B√∂rne analyzed German Jew-hatred into its constituents,
and showed the absurdity of each. On
another occasion (1820) he told them the stern
truth:</p>

<blockquote>

<p>"I pardon the German nation for its Jew-hatred, for it is a nation
of children, and for this reason, just like an infant, needs a go-cart to
enable it some day to stand firm, so that by means of the barriers to
liberty it may learn to do without barriers. The German nation
would collapse a hundred times a day if it were without prejudices.
But individual adults I cannot pardon for their Jew-hatred."</p></blockquote>

<p>Dr. Ludwig Holst, a newly-fledged Jew-hater,
who had developed his cult into a philosophical system,
and who, as B√∂rne says, sounded "a metaphysical
Hep, hep," was attacked by him with scoffs
and sneers.</p>

<blockquote>

<p>"Hatred of Jews is one of the Pontine bogs which poison the beautiful
land of our liberty. We see the hopeful friends of the fatherland
with pale faces wandering about hopelessly. German minds dwell
on Alpine heights, but German hearts pant in damp marshes. Holst
wishes to kill the Jews, and if they resist, he turns round to his circle
of onlookers, and says: 'Now you see that I am right in taxing the
Jews with unparalleled insolence; they will not suffer their heads to
be struck off ever so little, and they sulk.' ... You hate the
Jews, not because they have earned hatred, but because they earn
money.... What you call human rights, which, it must be
conceded you grant Jews, are only animal rights. The right of seeking
food, of devouring it, of sleeping, and of multiplying, are enjoyed
also by the beasts of the field&mdash;until they are slain, and to the Jews
you grant no more.... Men of Frankfort, Hamburg, L√ºbeck,
and Bremen, answer me. You complain that Jews are all usurers,
yet you prevent the mental development of those who abandon
usury! I will not be turned away; I demand a reply. Men of
Frankfort, tell me: Why should the practice of medicine be restricted
to four Jews, and that of the law be allowed to none?... In the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_544" id="Page_544">544</a></span>
same way in which you in your free city now storm against the Jews,
did you not twenty years ago storm against Catholics?... Do
you doubt the arrival of the day which will command you to look
upon Jews as your equals? But you wish to be <i>forced</i>! The German
is deaf. You will not obey voluntarily; fate will have to take
hold of you and drag you hither and thither. Shame upon you!"
B√∂rne remarks in conclusion: "I love neither Jew as Jew, nor
Christian as Christian; I love them because they are human beings,
and born to be free. Liberty shall be the soul of my pen, until it
becomes blunted, or my hand is lamed."</p></blockquote>

<p>But B√∂rne wished the Jews to forget as a bad
dream their history of a thousand years, and to
become Germans. He did not possess the far-sightedness
of Heine.</p>

<p>Heinrich Heine (born in D√ºsseldorf, 1799, died in
Paris, 1854) in his innermost self was infinitely more
of a Jew than B√∂rne; indeed, he possessed to a
great extent all the favorable and unfavorable characteristics
of Jews. Who can paint this "wicked
favorite of the Graces and Muses" (as he was
called), this scoffing romancer and lyrical philosopher,
with his chameleon-like nature? B√∂rne's
mind resembled transparent spring-water, which
trickles over pebbles, and foams only when attacked
by winds. Heine's mind, on the other hand, resembled
a whirlpool, upon whose surface the sunbeams
play in prismatic colors, but which drags approaching
vessels into its roaring depths, and dashes them
to pieces unless they are of the strongest build.
For Heine was as deep a thinker as he was an
artistic poet, as unrelenting a critic as he was an
amiable scoffer, as full of original thoughts as he
was of verses. Heine had not to search for Truth;
Truth flew to Heine. She, like the Muse, revealed
herself to him, jesting and playing with him as her
favorite. Behind his banter there often was more
earnest conviction than in the litany of a morose
moralist. Heine longed for ideals which his mind
could revere, and because he did not find them he
scoffed at the false gods who allowed themselves to
be worshiped. He has certainly given profound<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_545" id="Page_545">545</a></span>
solutions to problems of history. He never sacrificed
substance to form, when the former was of
greater value than the latter. It is true that he
often changed his opinions, but he did not play with
his convictions. His religious views changed also;
but he did not change his mind. He never wrote
or acted against such convictions as he entertained
at the time. If for a time he was slave to the false
philosophical theory which makes a god of man, he
afterwards acknowledged his error, and derided it
thoroughly. Heine was certainly no pattern of virtue,
neither was he so great a sinner as his sharp
pen and tongue might lead one to suppose. He
never lost his profound, noble nature, nor his sense
of the sublime; neither did he roll in the mud of
sensuality, as he would have his readers believe.
He painted himself blacker than he was. He had
his share of that acute sensitiveness which is the lot
of poets, actors, and preachers, and this morbid
state was in Heine's case connected with severe
nervous suffering. In his sensitive condition he
wrote things of which his sober judgment disapproved,
but which he was ashamed to recall.</p>

<p>Heine had an advantage over B√∂rne by reason
of his sincere affection for his mother. Betty von
Geldern came of a respected, it is said, an ennobled
Jewish family. This educated mother, to whom
he owed his bent of mind, was a religious woman,
and brought up her children in the knowledge of the
Jewish faith. The religious discord which had early
alienated B√∂rne from Judaism was unknown to
Heine, and in his youth he strictly avoided the
transgression of Jewish customs. He did not
indeed learn so much Hebrew as B√∂rne, but because
he imbibed with love the little that he did learn,
that little never left him, nor did he forget it later
in life, whilst B√∂rne wiped Hebrew entirely from his
memory. Heine's love of Judaism, which, in spite
of his mockery, was never quite dead, and especially<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_546" id="Page_546">546</a></span>
his deep understanding of it, sprang from the fond
memories of his youth, which remained with him
like sweet, pleasing dreams. His soul was also
filled with the charm of true Jewish family life, which
gave him the proper standard by which to measure
what men call virtue and happiness.</p>

<p>He had a warm though vague attachment to
Judaism or the Jewish race, to its pathetic history and
sacred books, and he was forcibly impressed by the
antiquity of Judaism and its continuity of existence,
defying time and myriads of obstacles. Now and
again Heine felt proud of belonging to this ancient
aristocracy. He felt what he wrote late in life:</p>

<blockquote>

<p>"Now I perceive that the Greeks were only handsome youths, but
the Jews have always been men, powerful, stubborn men, not only
in days of yore, but even at present, in spite of eighteen centuries of
persecution and misery. I have since learned to know them better,
and to value them more highly, and if pride of descent were not
always a foolish contradiction, I might feel proud of the fact that my
progenitors were members of the noble house of Israel, that I am a
descendant of those martyrs who have given a God and morality to
the world, and who have fought and suffered on all the battle-fields
of thought."</p></blockquote>

<p>This consciousness slumbered gently in him from
his youth onwards. But he did not clearly define
to himself his attitude towards Judaism. The Jews,
in whom solidity, high virtue, and morality were
still to be found, repelled him by their un√¶sthetic
exterior and religious ceremonies, which he did not
understand. He felt his sense of beauty wounded
by the repulsive exterior of Judaism and its representatives.
His eye could not penetrate through
ugly veils. The circle of more refined Jews, which
in early manhood he joined in Berlin&mdash;the older
men, Friedl√§nder, Ben-David, Jacobson, and their
young imitators&mdash;did not cherish Judaism so deeply
as to infuse into him the spirit of sacrifice for the
faith. And in the semi-Jewish circle which also
he frequented during his stay in Berlin, as in that of
Rachel von Varnhagen, at this time already baptized,
he beheld only thorough contempt for Jews and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_547" id="Page_547">547</a></span>
Judaism, and an enthusiastic, romantic predilection
for Christianity.</p>

<p>But Heine, unlike B√∂rne, had too independent a
judgment to be lured into idolatrous worship of the
intellectual idols of the day. Sophistry could not
undermine his devotion to Judaism. On the contrary,
Heine joined the society of a number of young
men whose object was to promote culture among
Jews, and as one of its members, he subscribed to their
tacit vow, not to suffer themselves to be baptized for
the sake of a government appointment. The impulse
by which he and the other members were actuated was
no doubt vague; but at any rate it manifests the
desire to do his share towards the improvement of
his brethren. He undertook to aid in strengthening
the society and in widening its scope. Heine's
opinion even of the much-despised Polish Jews was
not utterly unfavorable, and they found a champion
in him.</p>

<p>Heine would have espoused the cause of Judaism
with heart and soul, if Judaism itself, <i>i. e.</i>, its sons,
had developed powers of mind and character, if the
freshness of youth and attractive charms had been
coupled with the dignity of its old age, its purport,
and calling, and if it could have inspired respect in
the educated world. In his impatience he wished
to see Judaism, like the legendary Messiah chained
at Rome, suddenly divest itself of its ragged cloak,
its leprous skin, throw off its aspect of servitude,
and be transformed into a richly adorned, blooming,
commanding youth. The process of rejuvenescence
seemed to him too slow, the means employed too
petty, the bearing of those who wished to further it,
especially their coquetry with the dominant Church,
seemed to him to be weak, apish, and undignified.</p>

<blockquote>

<p>Israel lacks energy. Chiropodists (David Friedl√§nder and Co.)
have sought to heal the body of Judaism of its fatal excrescences, and
on account of their unskillfulness and their cobweb bandage of reason,
Israel must bleed to death. Would that the delusion that impotency,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_548" id="Page_548">548</a></span>
privation of strength, one-sided negation are glorious, might soon
cease.... We no longer have the courage to wear a beard, to
fast, to hate, and by reason of hatred to suffer. This is the motive
of our reformation. Those who have received their enlightenment
and education from comedians wish to give Judaism new decorations
and new scenes, and the prompter is to wear white bands instead of a
beard. They wish to pour the ocean into a neat little hand-basin....
Others desire evangelical Christianity under Jewish names."...
"Even I do not possess the strength of mind (he frankly
confessed) to wear a beard, and to allow myself to be called, 'dirty
Jew'."</p></blockquote>

<p>We see clearly his attachment to Judaism in the
case of his pardonable hatred of the oppressor and
despiser of his race, of the enemy who had received
salvation from Judaism, which he imprisoned and
spat upon. In the renewed pain of old wounds,
inflicted upon the Jews by heathen and Christian
Rome, he compressed a world of boiling anger into
the word Edom. Thus he jeered in a poem to
<span class="locked">Edom:&mdash;</span></p>

<div class="poem-container">
<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="iq">"For a thousand years or longer<br /></span>
<span class="i0">We bear with each other in a brotherly way;<br /></span>

</div><div class="stanza">
<span class="iq">"Only sometimes, on dark days,<br /></span>

<span class="i0">For I myself began to rave,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And I become almost like to thee."<br /></span>
</div></div>
</div>

<p>Still greater was Heine's hatred towards deserters,
traitors, Jews who for the sake of personal gain
turned their back upon their suffering brethren, and
went over to the enemy. Heine could not believe
that a Jew ever was baptized from earnest conviction;
baptism was in his opinion self-delusion, if
not a lie. The Gospel, preached in vain to the poor
of Jud√¶a, was now, as he averred, prospering among
the rich. Heine gave vent to this hatred in his
dramatic poem "Almansor" (completed in 1823).<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_549" id="Page_549">549</a></span>
But he found it unsuitable to introduce the characters
as Jews, to tell in glowing verses of their affliction
and the contempt in which they were held. He therefore
put these verses into the mouths of the Mussulmans
of Granada, who through devilish malice were
experiencing the same cruel fate as the Jews, and
who felt a yawning chasm in their hearts at having
been forced to embrace Christianity. It is unmistakable
that these verses breathe forth Jewish
suffering. The Jewish poet, however, incurred
bitter enmity by this drama.</p>

<p>It is proof of Heine's warm attachment to his race
that when he was deeply vexed by private and
public disappointments, he proceeded to glorify it.
The enthralling psalm, once sung by a Hebrew bard
at Babel's waters, was constantly in his mind:</p>

<div class="poem-container">
<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="iq">"May my tongue cleave parched<br /></span>
<span class="i0">To the roof of my mouth, and my right hand<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Wither, if ever<br /></span>
<span class="i0">I forget thee, O Jerusalem."<br /></span>
</div><div class="stanza">
</div></div>
</div>

<p>For affronts put upon him in connection with the
performance of "Almansor," it was his intention to
take thorough revenge on his German-Christian
enemies, and to hold up a mirror to them in a
Jewish novel. In the "Rabbi of Bacharach" he
described vividly, as only he could, the sad and the
glorious scenes of Jewish history, and to this end he
carefully studied the Jewish chronicles, as he wished
to keep strictly to history. His imagination only
illuminated facts, but did not invent them, there
being material enough at his disposal. Heine did
not shrink from ransacking the rubbish contained in
old books, such as Schudt's "Jewish Curiosities,"
"that memorial of Frankfort Jew-hatred"; and he
succeeded in extracting something even from chaff
and straw. "The spirit of Jewish history reveals
itself more and more to me, and the pursuit of it
will no doubt prove useful to me in the future." In
the course of Jewish history, outlined by acts of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_550" id="Page_550">550</a></span>
heroism and by sacrifices, he beheld a connection
between the plans of Providence: "In the same
year in which the Jews were expelled from Spain,
the new land of religious liberty was discovered."
The golden period of medi√¶val Jewish history&mdash;the
history of the Spanish Jews&mdash;had greatest charm
for him. In the foreground of this stage he wished
to introduce proud Jews, who would not bow their
necks beneath the yoke of German restrictions and
canonical arrogance, and who professed their religion
with pride; but this epoch was not well known
at that time, and Heine longed in vain for sources
whence to draw pregnant information. Instead of
facts, those to whom he applied gave him only
threshed straw. But Heine allowed no difficulty to
prevent his collecting interesting historical material
for his novel; this production was to be the child,
not of his hate, but of his love. He fairly basked in
it: "Since it proceeds from love, it will be an
immortal book, an ever-burning lamp in the palace
of God&mdash;no fitful theatrical light."</p>

<p>Heine's romance was indeed grandly conceived.
The scene of action was laid in Germany, but the
history of the Jews of Spain, their expulsion, and
enforced baptism, were to be the main incidents.</p>

<p>However, at the time when Heine was earnestly
engaged in the study of Judaism, and became enthusiastic
for its history, and hated Christianity most
fiercely, he quietly passed over to the Christian fold
(June 28, 1825), and assumed the baptismal name
of Christian Johann Heinrich. He had fought for a
long time against this temptation. He expressed
his opinion upon the question <span class="locked">plainly:&mdash;</span></p>

<blockquote>

<p>"Not one of my family is opposed to it except myself. This act
may be of importance to me, as through it I may the better devote
myself to the cause of my unhappy co-religionists. But I should consider
it a blot upon my dignity and honor, if I were to be baptized in
order to obtain a post in Prussia&mdash;in dear Prussia!... Vexation
may drive me to become a Catholic, and hang myself."</p></blockquote>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_551" id="Page_551">551</a></span>
In spite of this declaration he became a convert,
in order to obtain a position in Prussia, and also to
escape from humiliating dependence upon his uncle.
In his diary he wrote the following verses upon the
<span class="locked">subject:&mdash;</span></p>

<div class="poem-container">
<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="iq">"And unto the cross now bendest thou low,<br /></span>
<span class="i2">To the cross that erstwhile thou didst despise;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Which but a few short weeks ago<br /></span>
<span class="i2">Seemed so vile in thy scornful eyes."<br /></span>
</div></div>
</div>

<p>Shortly afterwards (July 20, 1825) he passed his
law examination. But he pursued phantoms, and
had made a vain sacrifice of his honor. He was
unable to procure employment, and could not dispense
with his uncle's support. Shamefaced as a
girl guilty of some fault, Heine communicated the
fact of his conversion in allegorical language to his
bosom friend Moser:</p>

<blockquote>

<p>"A young Spanish Jew, at heart a Jew, who, owing to the demands
of pleasure, had abjured his faith, corresponded with the youthful
Judah Abrabanel, and sent him a poem translated from the Moorish.
Perhaps he was loth to tell his friend in plain terms of his not very
creditable performance; still he sends the poem.&mdash;Do not meditate
about it."</p></blockquote>

<p>Through his apostasy, Heine became only the
more embittered against Christianity, as though it
were directly responsible for his faithlessness, his
loss of dignity, and his disloyalty to his better self.
"I assure you," he wrote to his intimate friend, "if
the law had permitted the stealing of silver spoons,
I should not have been baptized." When at about
the same time, Edward Gans, the leader of young
Israel, founder of the Society of Culture, and one
of its active promoters, also embraced Christianity,
Heine could not forgive him, for he had not been
compelled by poverty to take the step. Heine was<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_552" id="Page_552">552</a></span>
yet more indignant when informed that Gans had
induced weak-minded Jews to forsake their belief.</p>

<blockquote>

<p>"If he does it out of conviction, he is a fool; if out of hypocrisy, he
is a rascal."</p></blockquote>

<p>It also vexed him that his opponents would not
forget his Jewish origin, but, as in the case of B√∂rne,
reminded him of it at every opportunity. To
appease his conscientious scruples in a measure, he
continued to work at the romance, "The Rabbi of
Bacharach." Through its medium he desired to
make known his secret attachment to the Jews, and
he wished to publish it in spite of the advice of his
friend Moser, who was not blind to the glaring contradiction
between thought and act, and the enmity
it would necessarily draw down upon him.</p>

<p>Heine was not, however, so constituted as to
allow remorse to trouble him for any length of time.
Once having turned his back upon Judaism, he
sought to lull his conscience. His pleasure-seeking
after his conversion was only a means to this end.
Heine ingeniously labored to discover faults in the
Jews and Judaism, and thus to justify himself. In
this impulse originated his hostile sallies against
Judaism&mdash;that it is, for instance, "not a religion,
but a misfortune." Afterwards, he sought to make
the dividing line between Judaism and Christianity
very faint; he characterized both faiths as self-torturing,
monkish, and Nazarite; he vilified them
equally, disregarded both, and acknowledged a
Hellenistic religion of the "revival of the flesh."
Nevertheless, it may be said that, in bright moments,
his old love of Judaism revived, and he again showed
his thoughtful conception of it. It annoyed Heine
that Shakespeare should be reckoned among the
Jew-baiters because he had created "Shylock," and
he employed his brilliant eloquence to remove this
blemish from the Jews and Shakespeare.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_553" id="Page_553">553</a></span></p>

<blockquote>

<p>"Did Shakespeare aim at depicting a Jewess in Jessica? Certainly
not. He portrayed only a daughter of Eve, one of those pretty birds
who, as soon as they are fledged, flutter forth from the home-nest to
their lovers.... In Jessica there is especially noticeable a certain
timid shame which she cannot overcome in donning male garments.
In this trait one may, perhaps, recognize the modesty characteristic
of her race, which endows its daughters with so marvelous a charm.
The chastity of the Jews is probably the consequence of the aversion
which they felt to Oriental sensuality and the immoral worship which
flourished among their neighbors, the Egyptians, Assyrians, and
Babylonians, and has continued, changing only its outward form, to
the present day. The Jews are a chaste, abstemious, so to speak, an
abstract people, and in purity of morals, approach the German
nations.... The Greeks and Romans were devoted to the soil ...
the later Northern immigrants to the person of their chieftains ...
whilst the Jews from ancient times were attached to the law, to
abstract thought, like our modern cosmopolitan Republicans ...
liberty and equality were their religion."</p></blockquote>

<p>Advanced in years, when a severe nervous affliction
had still more cleared the mirror of his thoughts,
Heine became conscious of the superiority of morality
based upon piety over beauty, and returned
with his whole heart to the love of his youth, his
reverence for Judaism. His "Confessions" (1853&ndash;54)
are inspired hymns to Jewish history and the
Jewish people, and it is apparent that they are sincere.
He was always enthusiastic on behalf of the
Bible.</p>

<blockquote>

<p>"The Jews may console themselves for the loss of Jerusalem and
the Ark of the Covenant; this loss is but trifling when compared with
the Bible, the indestructible treasure which they have saved.... I
owe the re-awakening of my religious feelings to that Holy Book (the
Bible), and it has become for me equally the source of salvation and
the object of most ardent admiration.... I think I may flatter
myself that I comprehend the character of Moses as revealed in the
first portion of the sacred book (of the Old Testament). I consider
his a most imposing figure. What a giant form! How small Sinai
appears when Moses stands upon it! This mountain is only the
pedestal for the feet of the man, whose head reaches up to the heavens,
where he speaks with God.... Formerly, I felt no especial affection
for Moses, probably because the Hellenic spirit was paramount
in me, and I could not pardon the legislator of the Jews his hatred
against the plastic arts. I did not see that, notwithstanding his
hostility to art, Moses was a great artist, and possessed the true
artistic spirit! But this spirit was directed by him, as by his Egyptian
compatriots, to colossal and indestructible undertakings.... He
built human pyramids, carved human obelisks; he took a poor shepherd<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_554" id="Page_554">554</a></span>
family and created a nation from it, a great, eternal, holy people, a
people of God, destined to outlive the centuries, and to serve as a
pattern to all other nations, even as a prototype to the whole of
mankind: he created Israel.... As of the artist, so also
I have not always spoken with sufficient respect of his work, the Jews....
The history of the Middle Ages, and even of other times,
seldom inscribed in its annals the names of these knights of the holy
spirit, because they usually fought with closed visor. The deeds of
the Jews, as well as their peculiar character, are little known to the
world. One thinks one knows them, because their beards are visible,
but nothing else has come in view; and now, as in the Middle Ages,
they are a profound mystery, which may perhaps be revealed on the
day of which the prophet speaks....</p>

<p>"Yes, to the Jews, to whom the world owes its God, it also owes
His Word, the Bible; they saved it from the wreck of the Roman
Empire, and in the frantic scramble of migrating tribes they preserved
the precious book, until Protestantism sought it with them, translated
the discovered work into the vernacular, and disseminated it through
the whole world.... In the North of Europe and America, the
influence of Palestine has grown to be so great, that one can fancy
oneself transplanted into the midst of Jews.... I will not speak
of most of the new communities of the United States where the life of
the Old Testament is pedantically imitated ... but the caricature
will not disappear, and the real, imperishable, and true portion,
namely, the morality of ancient Judaism, will also flourish in those
countries as luxuriantly as in former days on the banks of the Jordan
and upon the heights of Lebanon. No palms are needed for man to
be good; and to be good is better than to be beautiful.... Jud√¶a
has always appeared to me as a piece of the West lost in the East.
In fact, with its spiritual belief, its severe, pure, almost ascetic morals,
its abstract inner life, this land and its people have ever formed a
remarkable contrast to the surrounding countries and their inhabitants,
who paid homage to the most licentious and infamous nature
cults, and dissipated their existence in bacchanalian orgies. Israel
piously sat beneath its fig-tree, and sang the praise of the invisible
God, and practised virtue and justice; whilst in the temples of Babylon,
Nineveh, Sidon, and Tyre, sanguinary and immoral rites were
celebrated, the description of which even now strikes us with horror.
When one thinks of its surroundings, this early greatness of Israel
cannot be sufficiently admired. Of Israel's love of liberty, whilst
slavery was justified not alone in its immediate vicinity but by all the
nations of antiquity, even by philosophers&mdash;of this I would rather not
speak, in order to avoid compromising the Bible with our present
rulers.... Instead of wrestling with the impossible, instead of
foolishly decreeing the abolition of property, Moses strove to render
it moral; he endeavored to bring the possession of property into
harmony with morality, with the law of reason, and this he effected
by the institution of the Jubilee, when all alienated hereditary property,
which amongst an agricultural people was land, reverted to the
original owners, no matter how they had lost possession thereof.
This ordinance offers a most decided contrast to the law of prescription
among the Romans.... Moses did not wish to abolish the
holding of property; his plan was that every one should possess some
land, that no one should become a slave, with slavish propensities,
through poverty, for freedom was the ultimate aim of the great emancipator,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_555" id="Page_555">555</a></span>
and this desire breathes through all his laws dealing with
pauperism. He detested slavery immoderately, almost fiercely....
If a slave, however, freed by law, refused to leave the house of his
master, Moses commanded that the incorrigible rascal be nailed by
his ear to the door-post of his master's house.... O Moses, our
teacher, Moshe Rabbenu, exalted enemy of serfdom, I pray thee
furnish me with hammer and nails, that I may nail our willing slaves,
in their liveries of black and red and gold, by their long ears to the
Brandenburg Gate."</p></blockquote>

<p>The spirit of the Jewish law and of Jewish history
had indeed come upon this erratic son of Israel,
and revealed to him what few of his predecessors
had thoroughly grasped, and none had so luminously
delineated. Heine appreciated equally the profound
wisdom displayed in the laws and the intellectual
contests in the centuries of Jewish history,
as also the precious ore of poetry, which streamed
forth from the greatest Jewish poet of the Middle
Ages. Scarcely had Michael Sachs, the preacher
with the Psalmist soul and prophetic speech, unveiled
the hidden beauties of the "Religious Poetry of the
Jews in Spain," and more especially the almost
forgotten glory of the poet Jehudah Halevi Alhassan,
before Heine, deeply moved, set up a memorial to
this singer and brother in race and art. With his
magic wand he invoked the shade of Jehudah Halevi
from the grave, and depicted him in his complete
ideality and the full glow of his inspiration.</p>

<p>Until his last breath the struggle continued
within Heine's breast between the two great principles
in the construction of the world's history, the
pure morality of Judaism and the symmetrical beauty
of Hellenism, both of which he reverenced, but was
unable to <span class="locked">reconcile:&mdash;</span></p>

of the two elements was the task of European
civilization; but he was unable to effect it in himself.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_556" id="Page_556">556</a></span>
From this conflict his aberrations arose, and also
his impulse to dominate them by ridicule, and thus
prevent their mastering him.</p>

<p>The Jewish world is greatly indebted to its two
apostate sons, B√∂rne and Heine. They did not
indeed destroy all German anti-Jewish feeling, but
they at least subdued it. Referring to the absurd
cry of "Hep, hep," Heine once said, "This can
never occur again, for the press is a weapon, and
there are two Jews who possess German style, the
one being myself, the other B√∂rne." His prediction
was nearly fulfilled, for since the appearance of these
two, such fierce outbreaks against Jews have not recurred.
Germany has not produced more talented,
more artistic, more refined writers than these two
Jews.</p>

<p>Young Germany, which originated the present
state of culture, and created the Year of Liberation,
1848, is the offspring of these two Jewish fathers.
Invective, calumny, and the secret police were perfectly
correct in designating the leaders of young Germany
as Jews, because without the influence of the
Jewish spirit they would not have become the champions
of freedom. Jew-haters thought that they were
inflicting disgrace on the fair-haired combatants in
calling them Jews, whilst actually they only bestowed
honor upon them. But the list of B√∂rne's and
Heine's services to Germany is not yet exhausted.
They induced the French to respect the staunchness
of the German spirit. B√∂rne and Heine were the
first to draw France and Germany together, to unite
German depth of thought with French elegance.
They first dispelled the clouds which separated these
two nations, causing the French people to ascend
and the Germans to descend the mountain, meet
each other half-way, and, regardless of mutual antagonism
and of their oppressors, stretch forth their
hands in brotherly union. This Messianic time,
when it arrives, will have been prepared by two
Jews, who were fulfilling their national mission.</p>

<p class="center b2">1818&ndash;1830 <span class="smcap smaller">C. E.</span></p>

<p>The advance of the Jews in Germany had been
completed in an amazingly short time, as appears
when we contrast Mendelssohn's reticence in
touching upon religious and political conditions in
Christendom with the boldness of B√∂rne and Heine,
who displayed them in their naked form. And
mark the progress made in France! Here the Jews
had become men, dauntlessly encountering every
opponent, and ready to avenge with the sword
insulting remarks on their origin. Judaism, however,
was less rapid in casting off servile forms than
its followers. For nearly two thousand years it had
struggled for existence against every new people
and every new tendency which appeared on the stage
of history. With Greeks and Romans, Parthians
and Neo-Persians, Goths and Slavonic tribes, with
Arabs and medi√¶val knights in armor, with monks
of every order and fanatic Lutherans, it had
maintained ever-recurring contests, and had of
necessity become covered with disfiguring scars
and foul dust. To defend itself against the assaults
of so many hostile powers and during so long a
period, Judaism had been compelled to surround
itself with an impenetrable coat of mail, to isolate<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_558" id="Page_558">558</a></span>
itself completely, or withdraw into a shrine of its
own, every access to which was carefully barricaded.
So accustomed had the Jews become to their heavy
armor, that it seemed to have grown into their very
being; nor could it be discarded so long as new
battles were imminent. Left to its own resources,
and excluded from the external world, especially
since the expulsion of its members from Spain and
Portugal, and their simultaneous banishment from
many German districts, Judaism had created a
dreamland for itself. It had admitted magical formulas
into its world of thought and fancy to distract
the minds of its adherents from pangs of torture, so
that they might endure them with greater ease, or
forget them entirely. Suddenly its sons were
awakened from their dreams by the dazzling sunlight,
and beheld the real world, to which they were utter
strangers. At first they closed their eyes the
tighter, in order to retain the pleasant dream-pictures.
In this new age, and in the new conditions,
they could not at once find their proper level,
and they feared that the altered state of affairs was
a mere stratagem, a novel method of warfare in
disguise, which their ancient enemies expected to
use against Judaism.</p>

<p>During its long journey through the world, and
its acquaintance with many nations, Judaism, in
spite of its exclusiveness, had admitted various perverse
ideas, which became as thoroughly a part of
itself, as if derived from the original stock. Memory
had been weakened through persecution and
martyrdom; the power of thought had also suffered
somewhat through daily increasing afflictions. At
first it was too distracted to apply tests, to distinguish
foreign and unfit elements from native and
essential parts and remove them. Among the
Jews in Germany, England, and France, the adoption
of the uncultivated Polish manner had conferred
a barbarous aspect upon Judaism, and among the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_559" id="Page_559">559</a></span>
Portuguese and Italian Jews, owing to Isaac Lurya
and Chayim Vital, it had assumed a Kabbalistic
form. This disfigurement of Judaism existing
among the Portuguese along with external decorum,
and its neglected condition in Polish and German
communities, affected every element of religious
life&mdash;divine service, sermons, marriages, interments,
in short, every ceremonial, especially those
of a public nature. The official representatives and
expounders of Judaism, the rabbis and leaders of
divine service, were repulsive, either semi-barbarians
or visionaries. The foreign additions and
excrescences, the fungous growth attached to the
original trunk, were regarded by these leaders of
Judaism as integral elements. The times had not
yet matured men, who, by a delicate perception of
the inner kernel of Judaism (as contained in the
Bible and the Talmud), by wide vision, and clear
insight, could recognize the abuses that had accumulated
in the course of time, and separate them
from the essential parts. To remove these objectionable
excrescences gradually, and with a gentle
hand, without giving offense, required profound
understanding. A necessary reform, not prompted
by external considerations, had been suggested
several centuries earlier by far-sighted men; but
the modern generation had no knowledge thereof.
Neither was there any adequate representative
body in the Jewish world. There was, to be sure,
an organization, possessing, or in a position easily
to obtain, a sort of official character and authority,
namely, the French Synhedrion and Consistory.
But the chiefs, David Sinzheim and Abraham di
Cologna, had not the needful discernment to accomplish
the ennoblement and rejuvenescence of Judaism.
Sinzheim was only an orthodox Talmudist,
and Di Cologna an interesting preacher. The right
men were wanting to undertake and promote this
much-needed reform, not of the religion itself&mdash;for<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_560" id="Page_560">560</a></span>
neither the leaders nor the rank and file had lost
any degree of morality through the deterioration of
Judaism&mdash;but of its exterior, to beautify it and
remove excrescences. No men being forthcoming,
time effected the changes, and so quarrels and contentions
were produced. It was destined to be no
easy work for Judaism to cast its slough.</p>

<p>The changes in Judaism, like those in the Jews,
began in Germany. To the German Jews (because
Mendelssohn had come from their midst) a task was
allotted similar to that achieved in earlier times by
the Alexandrian and Spanish, and in part by the
Proven√ßal Jews, that of reconciling Judaism with
culture. But when these efforts commenced, the
situation was already one of great confusion, and
the method by which they were conducted only
intensified the difficulties. During the struggles of
the German Jews to secure emancipation, when
every step towards freedom was accomplished only
after the most strenuous exertions, when each
advance was met with scorn and neglect, when they
were continually being hurled back into their humiliated
condition and reminded of their despised
state, two equally unpleasant phenomena manifested
themselves. Those who, improved by culture and
education, swam with the stream, estranged themselves
from Judaism, disowned all connection with
its official acts, and despised it as the obstacle to
their civil or social advancement. To them Judaism
appeared as a mummy, a petrifaction, or a specter,
which restlessly and aimlessly flitted through the
centuries, a picture of grief beyond help. Only a
few of this educated class, like Heine in his bright
moments, when not led astray by wantonness, were
clear-sighted enough to recognize life in this
mummy, capable some day of bursting its cerements
and engaging in combat with its enemies.
On the other hand, the majority of the Jews, who
still bore in their hearts deep love for the wrinkled<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_561" id="Page_561">561</a></span>
mother of all religions, clung to those unessential
forms to which from youth they had been accustomed,
because they perceived the treachery of the
opposite party, and did not wish to be classed
amongst the betrayers of Judaism. "They loved
stones, and treasured dust." Theirs was no longer
the innocent piety of bygone days which had no
opposition to contend with, but an active, passionate
feeling. The representatives of the old school
became anxious and suspicious about the growing
weakness of religious feeling, the loosening of all
bonds of union, the manifest symptoms of apostasy,
and the contempt for their origin. Judaism seemed
a gigantic structure composed of tiny cubes, supporting
each other and the whole. They feared the
downfall of the whole edifice, if a single support
became loose. They had no confidence in the permanence
of the structure, for whose maintenance
they were ready to sacrifice their lives. They
would give up not even the use of their miserable
jargon, defiant of every grammatical law, in the
ritual, nor their indecorous habits, nor any particular
of their disorderly system. Every sign of yielding,
any departure from the old order, appeared to them
an act of treachery to Judaism.</p>

<p>It seemed impossible to find a means of uniting
these opposites. Nevertheless, an attempt was
made, but in a rough, unskillful manner, the result
being that the advance of Judaism was retarded for
a considerable time. The first to undertake some
sort of reform was Israel Jacobson. He was especially
fitted for the leadership of a new party by his
attachment to his faith, his admiration for beauty
and external qualities, his activity, wealth, and high
position. Immediately after the Westphalian Consistory
had been appointed, and he had been placed
at its head, he came forward with innovations of a
two-fold nature. From the public service in the
synagogue connected with the newly-erected school<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_562" id="Page_562">562</a></span>
in Cassel, he removed all objectionable and noisy
features, especially the sing-song reading so much
in use. He naturally insisted upon the delivery of
sermons in German. He also introduced new
forms and methods borrowed from the Church, such
as German as well as Hebrew prayers, insipid German
songs by the side of the psalms pregnant with
thought, and the ceremony of confessing the faith
(Confirmation) for half-grown boys and girls&mdash;an
idea without meaning in Judaism.</p>

<p>Jacobson exercised such power over his associates
in the Westphalian Consistory, that they unresistingly
accepted these innovations. He then
proceeded to introduce his reforms into all the
communities of Westphalia, with the threat that he
would have such synagogues as refused to adopt
his regulations closed. This compulsion, however,
aroused the feelings of the orthodox party; the
introduction of the German language into divine
service being particularly objectionable to the
majority. A rabbi of mild temperament, Samuel
Eger of Brunswick (died 1842), had the courage to
protest against the arbitrary conduct of the president
of the consistory. He prophetically expressed
the conviction, that by employing German prayers
and hymns the Hebrew language would fall into
disuse, and finally die out, and the bond uniting the
Jews dispersed throughout the world would thereby
be relaxed. Jacobson appears to have paid no
heed to these warnings and signs of opposition.
The dissatisfied Jews must have lodged complaints
about him and his new schemes with King Jerome,
for the king reprimanded him for his autocratic
interference in matters of conscience and his ardor
for reform.</p>

<p>Jacobson's glory ended with the speedy downfall
of the Westphalian kingdom. Having moved to
Berlin, he furnished a room in his house as a synagogue
(1815), although he had formerly been<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_563" id="Page_563">563</a></span>
opposed to private synagogues, and introduced his
reformed service with German prayers, songs, and
a choir. At first there was no room for an organ.
Afterwards Jacob Beer, the banker, the father of
Meyer Beer, provided a large chamber (1817),
where an organ could be put up. After the victory
of the Germans over Napoleon, it became the fashion
to be religious, and it infected Jews who had
previously not experienced the slightest necessity
for devotional exercises, and had been quite indifferent
to religious ceremonial. Such sentimentalists,
who had no regard for Judaism, attended the services
of Jacobson, in order to "edify themselves"
and "be devout," as the new phrases ran. The
"Society of Friends" furnished members. This
was the origin of a Reform party, a tiny community
within the community, which however, as could be
easily foreseen, had a future, owing to the energy
displayed at the commencement and the repulsive
form of the ordinary divine service. The great
attraction in the new form of service was the German
sermon, which Jacobson usually delivered.
His addresses exercised great power, because the
so-called "homiletic discourses" of the rabbis and
the Polish or Moravian itinerant preachers, were
dull and unattractive.</p>

<p>But the private synagogue in Berlin, owing to
complaints made by some of the orthodox party,
was closed by the Prussian government. The king
of Prussia, Frederick William III, was averse to all
innovations, even in Jewish circles, and hated them
as being revolutionary plots. A young preacher
from the school of Jacobson thereupon betook himself
to Hamburg, having been invited to conduct a
free school established by certain rich Jews. Here
he set on foot the plan of erecting a reform temple
on the model of Jacobson's.</p>

<p>This young minister, Kley, had brought from
Jacobson's synagogue a complete scheme, which<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_564" id="Page_564">564</a></span>
included German hymns and prayers, sermons, and
the organ. He composed a so-called "religious
song-book," in imitation of the Protestant liturgy,
an empty and feeble work, suited only to a race of
children, ignorant of the psalms, the pattern sources
of religious devotion. But there were men in Hamburg
who, although they approved of modern ideas,
were yet unwilling to break entirely with Judaism
and its past, and who decidedly objected to the
omission of Hebrew in their prayers. The chiefs
of this movement were M.&nbsp;J. Bresselau, himself a
good Hebrew stylist, and S√¶ckel Fr√§nkel (died in
Hamburg, 1833), likewise a Hebrew scholar, who
had retranslated several of the Apocryphal books
into the sacred language. These two men compiled
a selection from the Hebrew prayers in use, in
order to amalgamate them with the newly-adopted
German songs and prayers, a discordant medley in
contents and form, which somewhat called to mind
a friendly compromise among contending parties.
About fifty families joined, and thus arose the
Reform Temple Union in Hamburg. This mongrel
birth was ushered into the world without love and
enthusiasm. Its promoters were so prosaic that
the anniversary of the battle of Leipsic was chosen
for the day of the consecration of the Temple (October
18, 1818). The preacher Kley, in order to have
ample material for a discourse, had to use as a
starting point the German wars of freedom, which
had caused the Jews in Germany to retrograde
rather than to advance. Young maidens sang
hymns with the young men, in order to create the
sensation which the cause itself could not awaken,
and this gave great offense. Kley could not have
kept the Temple community together for long, had
not the Templars, as they were called, found an efficient
preacher in Gotthold Salomon, of Dessau (died
1862), who was well acquainted with biblical and
Jewish literature, and knew how to conceal the bareness<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_565" id="Page_565">565</a></span>
of the new movement. On the one hand, he
invested the Temple with Protestant attributes, and
on the other, by reason of his conceit and ostentation,
he gave it an aggressive character. With
Salomon the influence of the preacher among the
German Jews commenced; the pulpit took the
place of the school, and from it there often resounded
the hollow phrases which conceal thought, or
the lack of thought. The Temple Union had officially
given up the belief in the Messiah, without
exactly defining what position Judaism was to
assume with reference to Christianity. Some of the
zealous reformers meditated a complete rupture,
and the refusal to contribute to the communal funds.</p>

<p>The originators and leaders were filled with the
delusive idea, which at first appeared justifiable,
that the Temple, through its modern and attractive
form of service, would bring back to the fold those
alienated from Judaism. They hoped that the less
stringent religious forms would overcome the dislike
felt by worldly men against everything Jewish.
In a few instances those who had fallen away from
Judaism were restrained from overstepping the
threshold into the Church, but it was not a remedy
with permanent effect. Nevertheless, the achievements
of the Hamburg Temple, commonplace though
its origin was, are not to be underrated. At one
stroke, without much hesitation, it banished the rubbish
of centuries from the synagogue, swept away
with youthful impetuosity the holy cobwebs which
no one had ventured to touch, and awakened a taste
for a well-regulated service, for decorous behavior
at divine worship, and for order and simplicity. The
injury inflicted on Judaism by the aping of foreign
customs, and the dilution of its own strength, cannot
be altogether attributed to it.</p>

<p>Naturally the establishment of the Hamburg Temple
produced a split in the Jewish world. Hitherto
there had existed only the "old-fashioned" and the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_566" id="Page_566">566</a></span>
"new-fashioned" people, as they termed each other,
but no distinct sects possessing a banner, a password,
and a confession of faith. Not even the old-fashioned
orthodox section constituted a definite
party. For, although the adherents of the past,
who would not swerve a hair's breadth from former
practices, were so numerous, that even in Hamburg
they might have suppressed the innovators if they
had chosen, they did not act as a body. Only the
faint remonstrance of single individuals was heard
lamenting the ruin of Judaism through its betrayers,
and these oft-repeated wailings were pitiful. The
old party had no chiefs, no leaders; respect for
the rabbis had vanished in a single generation. The
wretched dispute for and against Jonathan Eibesch√ºtz,
and the satires of Hebrew writers of the
period of the Measfim, had completely undermined
their authority. In the larger German congregations
the empty rabbinical chairs were permitted to
remain untenanted. They no longer wished to have
rabbis from Poland, because these could not speak
the language of the land, and in Germany there
were no great rabbis of recognized authority. Berlin
set the example, which was followed by the community
of Prague, after the death of the wise
Ezekiel Landau, by Hamburg after the retirement of
the zealot Raphael Cohen, and by Frankfort-on-the-Main
after the death of the ultra-orthodox (Chassidic)
Pinchas Hurwitz. The assistants (Dayanim)
of the rabbis administered the rabbinical office&mdash;hybrid
creatures, too dependent to have an opinion
of their own, and too weak to oppose the demands
of reckless leaders of communities.</p>

<p>As a result of the disregard in which the rabbis
were held, the Talmudical schools fell into decay.
Gifted Jewish youths, whose education formerly had
begun with the Talmud, preferred to attend the
gymnasiums and universities, and learned to despise
the Talmud and Judaism. The most famous Talmudical<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_567" id="Page_567">567</a></span>
academies in Prague, Frankfort, Altona
and Hamburg, F√ºrth, Metz, and Halberstadt, which
had boasted at least several hundred pupils
(Bachurim), were gradually closed. This desolation
spread to Poland, as the Talmud students no longer
had hope of finding employment in Germany and
France. They still made their way to Germany, but
with the intention of studying science (Chochmoth),
or if they remained at home, they devoted themselves
to the ensnaring mysticism of Neo-Chassidism.
There were but four rabbis of the younger generation
who, on account of their profound knowledge
of the Talmud and their pure, patriarchal character,
enjoyed widespread authority: Mordecai Benet, in
Nikolsburg, Jacob Lissa, Akiba Eger, and his son-in-law,
Moses Sofer, of Frankfort-on-the-Main. These
four rabbis, by their ingenious methods, kept alive
the zeal for Talmudical study. Akiba Eger, owing
to his astoundingly ingenious mind and high virtues&mdash;among
which modesty was pre√´minent&mdash;enjoyed
almost divine reverence from the thousands of
disciples who came from his academies in Friedland
and Posen. He was a quiet man, who never took the
initiative, and was averse to aggressive opposition.
Moses Sofer, on the other hand, was a fanatical
zealot and an active heretic-hunter. He possessed
courage and determination which disregarded consequences.
He might have been a useful leader,
but, like his companions, he was at too great a distance
from the scene of action, to take part in the
contest, or even to set up a standard. These rabbis
had not the slightest conception of the new tendency
which the times and the Jews had developed, and
were therefore ignorant of the importance of the
cause which they represented. They did not know
the enemy whom they attacked, or despised him too
much to be dangerous opponents. When a serious
question or a critical situation arose, they were at
a loss what to do, brought out their old rusty weapons,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_568" id="Page_568">568</a></span>
and damaged their cause by revealing its weakness.
This awkwardness created an impression of
feebleness and decrepitude. Thus the old orthodox
party (as their opponents, borrowing the name from
Church phraseology, termed them), or conservatives,
were without a head, without a banner or a plan,
utterly without unanimity or discipline, without
consciousness of their own strength. They especially
lacked eloquence, the indispensable means by which
public opinion is influenced and ruled, and its follies
and hollow emptiness are made apparent. Their
utter want of education avenged itself bitterly upon
the rigidly pious party.</p>

<p>On the other hand, the opposing section, the ardent
innovators, the party of Jacobson, possessed what
was wanting in the others: a daring leader, unity,
and especially a wealth of passwords and phrases,
such as, "spirit of the times, enlightenment," by
which the thoughtless are captivated. Their victory
and ultimate success could be foreseen. They had
confidence and the courage of youth, were bold, and
not over-particular as to the means employed.
Jacobson, their chief, knew how to pursue and
achieve an end, and how to utilize the means at his
disposal. He saw that the Hamburg Temple would
encounter difficulties, and would be condemned as
heretical by the old rabbis. Jacobson was in correspondence
with the founders, and knew that the
Senate, instigated by the orthodox party, would, like
the king of Prussia, forbid innovations. He also saw
that many of the Hamburg Templars were too lukewarm
to struggle against great difficulties. For this
reason he strove to obtain in advance the ratification
of the Temple ritual. Among the rabbis of Germany
he could find no voice of approval for the new
order of service. He, therefore, connected himself&mdash;a
fact which throws no favorable light upon the
cause&mdash;with a base adventurer, who, it appears, was
bribed to help him. Eleazar Libermann from<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_569" id="Page_569">569</a></span>
Austria, a gambler, became his apostle of reform.
To characterize the man, it suffices to note that he
afterwards was baptized. At the bidding of the
reformers, Libermann traveled in Austria. From
him they learned that in Hungary and Italy there
were rabbis or would-be rabbis, willing to pronounce
a favorable opinion upon the new ritual. Jacobson
addressed his inquiries to them, and his wishes were
fulfilled. The first who allowed himself to be used
by Libermann was Aaron Chorin (from Chorin),
rabbi in Arad, Hungary, a tedious talker of superficial
culture and mediocre Talmudical scholarship,
who was capable of repeating absurdities
in three languages&mdash;in Hebrew, German, and the
Jewish-German jargon. He was devoted to the
new movement without clearly understanding its
bearings. Two Italian rabbis of low attainments
also spoke in favor of the innovations. The
opinions of all these men&mdash;not one of whom
was of wholly sound mind&mdash;showed that the introduction
of the organ was not against Rabbinical law.
Chorin alone produced authorities in favor of the
other reforms, and for German prayers. Libermann
collated these opinions, strengthened them by his
own pretended learning, adding the falsehood that
not only all the rabbis of Leghorn, but even those
of Jerusalem, had declared it permissible to use the
organ in Jewish divine service. These opinions,
which were printed and scattered broadcast, were
intended to exonerate the Hamburg Reform Temple
from blame at its very birth, and to remove the blot
of illegitimacy which, as might have been foreseen,
the rabbis of the old school would affix to it.</p>

<p>Whilst the reformers energetically tried to forestall
every obstacle, the conservatives remained idle,
and allowed the dangers which threatened their
convictions to gather unnoticed. As already
observed, Hamburg had at this time no rabbi at its
head, but a college of three assistants (Dayanim) of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_570" id="Page_570">570</a></span>
little repute. Although these official representatives
of Judaism had almost the entire Hamburg
community to support them, they opposed the innovations
with little vigor. Shortly after the opening
of the Temple, the college ordered a feebly-written
proclamation to be put up in the synagogues (October
26, 1818), that the new prayer-book should not
be used by Israelites of pious sentiments, because
contrary to usage essential passages had been
omitted or altered. But this declaration lost its
effect, when the lay heads of the community&mdash;whose
assistance the Dayanim had not been able to win&mdash;took
it down, and rebuked the authors, because
"they had been guilty of intolerable presumption."
The lay heads, at the recommendation of the college,
afterwards invited the leaders of the Temple
(November 8th) to a meeting, and requested them
to discontinue the use of the prayer-book, as it did
not agree with the ritual accepted by all Jewish
communities. The Templars, however, laughed
this demand to scorn.</p>

<p>The Temple Union unexpectedly received moral
support from a person having great influence in
Hamburg. Lazarus Riesser, the father of the indefatigable
champion for the emancipation of the Jews
in Germany, had always been reckoned one of the
old orthodox party. As the son-in-law of Rabbi
Raphael Cohen and his right hand, he was absorbed
in the Talmud. He had published a Hebrew life of
Raphael Cohen, in which he eulogized not only the
author, but also his rabbinical views, and declared
himself his faithful follower. How astonished, therefore,
were the Hamburg Jews of both parties when
a letter from Riesser suddenly appeared, entitled
"To my Co-religionists in Hamburg" (the beginning
of 1819), applauding the Temple innovations,
and sharply rebuking the rabbinical college which
had opposed them! He frankly called the opponents
"sanctimonious hypocrites" who "nourish<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_571" id="Page_571">571</a></span>
contentions in Israel, and bar the way of the sons
desirous of returning to the favor of their father."
It appears that he wished to wreak a petty revenge
upon the members of the rabbinical college of
Hamburg, by whom he perhaps thought himself kept
in the background.</p>

<p>The orthodox party in Hamburg, who imagined
that no rabbi in the whole of Europe would approve
of the reforms, were bitterly disappointed; owing
to the activity of Jacobson and Libermann, the
Jewish public discovered that several rabbis in various
districts upheld them. The old rabbis were so
listless and indolent in the matter, that they had to
be addressed twice, before they pronounced judgment
against the Temple. In the first excitement
the Hamburg rabbis had unwisely condemned the
innocent and commendable customs which were
introduced into the Temple, such as the Portuguese
pronunciation of Hebrew, the omission of intoning
in reading from the Bible. To rectify these mistakes,
they afterwards limited their complaints to
three points&mdash;the abridgment of the prayers, especially
with reference to the omission of Messianic
passages, prayers in German, and the use of the
organ. To this programme the agreement of numerous
distinguished rabbis and rabbinates was at
length secured; four in Germany (F√ºrth, Mayence,
Breslau, and Hanau), five in Italy (Trieste, Modena,
Padua, Mantua, and Leghorn), three in Prussian
Poland (Posen, Lissa, and Rawitz), and two in
Moravia (Nikolsburg and Trietsch). Moses Sofer
in Presburg, the German rabbi in Amsterdam, and
the French chief rabbis of the consistory of Wintzenheim,
also signed the document. They all
declared the reforms in the Temple to be distinctly
heterodox. Libermann's falsehoods now became
apparent, as the Leghorn rabbinate had not given
its assent to the use of the organ. Samun, a would-be
rabbi of Leghorn, and Chorin of Arad, probably<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_572" id="Page_572">572</a></span>
under moral compulsion, revoked their former testimonials.
The most zealous in their denunciations
of the Temple were Sofer of Presburg and Benet of
Nikolsburg, who declared the slightest deviation
from ancient usages as heresy. But the impression
which the authors of this document had hoped for
did not follow. It had been delayed too long, more
than seven months having elapsed before sentence
of heresy was promulgated; and meantime the
Temple Union had established itself. Eighteen
antagonistic rabbinates (in all forty rabbis) did not
seem many; and the most eminent of all, the Central
Consistory of France, had remained silent.
The signers of the protest asserted that more opinions
had been received; but this belated statement
was of no avail. The arguments adduced by the
rabbis against the Temple service were for the most
part void, some were thoroughly childish. The
letter of the law spoke against them. The diversity
of opinions among rabbinical authorities of various
ages and countries, always made it possible to
find reasons for and against any question.</p>

<p>This weakness was mercilessly exposed by M.&nbsp;J. Bresselau, one of the originators of the Hamburg
reform. In a Hebrew letter (1819) written in
beautiful Hebrew style and with such skillful manipulation
of biblical verses, that it seemed as though
the prophets and psalmists themselves were scourging
the delusions of the obtuse rabbis, Bresselau
treated them now as ignorant boys, now as false
prophets, and especially as disturbers of the peace.
Every sentence in this seemingly earnest but
bitingly satirical epistle was a dagger-thrust against
the old perversions and their defenders. The
reformers also obtained reinforcement from Poland.
The old-fashioned party, on the other hand, were
unable to present a single Hebrew writer to defend
their cause. Even the Hebrew style used in the
document of the opposing rabbis was rugged and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_573" id="Page_573">573</a></span>
coarse. The Dayanim of Hamburg, indeed, caused
the testimonial to be in part translated into German&mdash;a
concession that betrayed the weakness of
their cause&mdash;but the German version was not calculated
to create a good impression. For this they
had to employ Shalom Cohen, a turn-coat, who had
formerly belonged to the ranks of the reformers.
In short, the conservatives were unfortunate, because
they were unskillful and imprudent.</p>

<p>It also happened that the Temple quarrel took
place in the year when the "Hep, hep!" cry was
being raised, and Hamburg also participated in it.
The wealthy and worldly Jews were thereby restricted
to the society of their own people, and actively
supported the banner that had been unfurled. The
Jewish merchants of Hamburg, members of the
Temple Union, who were accustomed to attend the
fair at Leipsic during the chief festivals in the spring
and autumn, joined some Berlin merchants of similar
opinions, and established a branch synagogue
(September 20, 1820). Meyerbeer composed the
songs for the opening ceremony. They appointed
a so-called fair-preacher (Messprediger), Jacob
Auerbach, and from this gathering-place of Jews
from various countries, the innovations spread to a
wider circle. The Hamburg reforms thus were
adopted in some parts; and in other communities,
such as those of Carlsruhe, K√∂nigsberg, and
Breslau, where the entire programme was not carried
out, at least the rite of confirmation, imitated
from the Church, was introduced.</p>

<p>The first attempt to set up an opposing party, so
as to dam the overflowing stream of reform, and
make it subside into a quiet bed, commenced on
account of the Temple innovations. This opposing
party was established by a man who had himself
partially forsaken rabbinical Judaism, but who strove
to strengthen and vindicate it, under the correct
impression that development must take place upon<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_574" id="Page_574">574</a></span>
its own soil, with due regard to historical conditions,
and along its peculiar lines, and especially without
aping foreign Church forms. Isaac Bernays (born
at Mayence, 1792; died at Hamburg, 1849) was
the man who intelligently opposed the prevailing
flaccidity of semi-enlightened reform and thought.
In South Germany, in contradistinction to North
Germany with its love for formal statements of doctrines,
which never rose beyond the commonplaces
of rationalism, a mystic philosophical school had
been established, which promoted visionary notions.
In all things, the smallest and the greatest, in nature
and history, in the grouping of things, in numbers,
colors, and names, this philosophy beheld a system,
germs of ideas, the shattered ruins of a gigantic
mirror reflecting fundamental thoughts in huge size.
Isaac Bernays belonged to this school. To his vision
Judaism in its literature and historical progress
revealed itself half unveiled. Bernays' mind, with
its overflowing wealth of ideas, found in all phenomena
the harmonious systemization and development
of a fundamental thought, which to manifest
all its latent possibilities permeated passing events
and historical achievements, and which had developed
from the beginning of creation to the most
recent fact. Bernays, much profounder than Mendelssohn,
was the first to recognize the important
r√¥le of Judaism in the history of the world, and at a
glance to measure the range of its literature. His
fault was, perhaps, that he was too rich in ideas,
that therefore he sought out and discovered too
much, and was not equal to the task of clothing his
ideas in fitting form and language. From his superior
altitude he looked with contemptuous pity
upon the poverty of thought of Jewish reformers,
who desired to contract and confine the giant spirit
of Judaism (of which they had no conception) within
the narrow bounds of a catechism for big and little
children. In his eyes the followers of Friedl√§nder<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_575" id="Page_575">575</a></span>
were the embodiment of insipidity and narrowness.
They impressed Bernays with the idea of a rabble
who dwell in a Pyramid, and fit it up for petty
household purposes.</p>

<blockquote>

<p>"They, the disciples of Mendelssohn, ashamed of their antiquity,
prefer, as foundlings of the present day, wildly to overleap the unfashionable
limits of the Law, instead of listening in the school of their
race, to hear what God has brought about at the present day."</p></blockquote>

<p>The train of thought by which Bernays reconstructed
Judaism in his mind from its original
sources and history, is little known to us. He preferred
oral to written instruction, and was averse to
put his thoughts on paper. The "Biblical Orient,"
which is ascribed to him, is, so to speak, only the
foundation of the vestibule of a reverence-inspiring
temple. This work, odd as it was in form, is distinguished
for its depth and originality; it starts
with the idea, that to Judaism is allotted the task
of bringing back to God men created in His image,
and that the Jewish people was to serve as a type
to mankind, showing how the lost likeness to God
may be regained. The "Biblical Orient" endeavored
to establish a more thorough comprehension
of the Bible than had been effected by the Mendelssohnian
school. They had regarded it merely from
its poetical side, and had failed to see that it portrays
the collision between two views of life. Bernays
believed that his criticism dethroned the
Mendelssohn school, together with its founder; for
Mendelssohn himself, by his superficial treatment of
Hebrew literature, had been the first to contribute
to the enervation of Judaism.</p>

<p>According to the opinion of Bernays, the Hebrew
cult differed from that of the heathen, and was
intended to be a contrast. Idolatry expressed itself
in plastic, Judaism in ritual, symbolism. Therefore
the very aspect of Judaism which the reformers
desired to abolish as unfitting and unworthy, should
be preserved. Everything which in the course of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_576" id="Page_576">576</a></span>
Jewish history had been assimilated and developed,
according to Bernays, ought to have a place
assigned to it, being a necessary part of the whole,&mdash;even
Talmudism and the Kabbala.</p>

<p>This book contains many immature and unpolished
ideas, much that borders on the ridiculous.
But if the author only succeeded in awakening
the idea that Judaism has an historical mission as
an apostle to the nations, it should suffice to procure
for him a place of honor in the records of Jewish
history. Not that he could claim this as a new
discovery, for the text-book of Judaism plainly
points to it. It is the essence of the messages proclaimed
by the prophets. It has been verified by
history, that European and Asiatic nations have
been delivered from their darkness by the light that
came from Judaism. But the accumulated sufferings
of the Jews, and the servile form assumed by
Judaism, had caused this fact to be so entirely forgotten,
that its own sons had no idea thereof. The
merit of the man who again called it to mind is
therefore of no mean degree.</p>

<p>The extraordinary talents and original ideas of
Bernays directed the attention of Jewish society to
him. Afterwards, it is true, he denied the authorship
of the "Biblical Orient"; but if he did not
actually compose it, he might have done so, for it is
flesh of his flesh, or spirit of his spirit.</p>

<p>The Hamburg community, which sorely needed a
power to withstand the Temple Union, in consequence
of his renown chose Bernays for their spiritual
guide. It was a good move on their part, and
bore important results. The rabbis of the old
school were ill prepared for the contest between
two justifiable principles, the preservation of Judaism
in its peculiar manifestations, and the assimilation
of European culture by the Jews. Their
weapons had grown rusty, and injured the owners
more than their opponents. Fresh forces were<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_577" id="Page_577">577</a></span>
therefore required in their cause&mdash;men cognizant
of the wants of the age, who could utilize them
for the honor and purification of Judaism. The
appointment of Bernays to the Hamburg rabbinate
(November, 1821) created a stir: he was the first
rabbi with a well-ordered secular education. It was
a sign of the times that he dispensed with the title
of rabbi and preferred to be called Chacham, as was
customary among the Portuguese Jews: he did not
wish the despised title of rabbi to be a hindrance to
his activity. True to his aversion for slavish imitation,
he eschewed all clerical mummery in costume
and gestures, to which the reform preachers attached
great importance in the pulpit. Bernays did not
claim to be the guardian of souls, only the teacher
of his congregation. He also delivered sermons,
but the contents, form, and other details differed
entirely from those introduced by the Jacobson
school. Owing to his peculiar mode of thought,
his addresses were not understood by the multitude;
but thoughtful hearers at least conceded to
him the merit of originality, which contrasted favorably
with the insipidity of the Temple preachers.
When Heine, who at this time was still interested
practically in Judaism, was staying in Hamburg, he
was induced to hear Bernays' sermons, and to compare
them with those of other preachers. Heine
understood the method and form of his thoughts,
and the opinion of the lyrical satirist ran as follows:</p>

<blockquote>

<p>"I have heard Bernays preach ..., none of the Jews understand
him, he desires nothing for himself, and will never play any other
part; but he is a man of mind, and has more life in him than Kley,
Salomon, and Auerbach I and II."</p></blockquote>

<p>By unobtrusive work, Bernays succeeded in gaining
the respect, not only of the community, but also
of the rigidly pious party elsewhere. Their suspicious
natures found nothing to blame in the religious
conduct of the Chacham. The changes that
he introduced, in reality reforms, met with approval<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_578" id="Page_578">578</a></span>
and imitation in orthodox congregations. By his
penetration and his great erudition he exercised
deep influence over the rising generation, to whom
he opened up the rich treasures of Jewish literature,
then but little known. He thereby imbued his disciples
with joyous attachment to Judaism. As
already stated, he did not care for writing. If his
courage had kept pace with his knowledge and
wealth of ideas, his activity would have had greater
influence on modern Jewish history.</p>

<p>In another quarter, an equally beneficent and elevating,
though differently constituted, personality,
was at work. Isaac Noah Mannheimer (born at
Copenhagen, 1793; died at Vienna, 1864), originally
a disciple of the school of Jacobson, softened
its crudities, and so caused the offensive alterations
in the divine service to be received favorably; he
struck the right note when making improvements.
He may justly be considered the incarnation of Jewish
refinement&mdash;every inch a man. In him the
essential elements of peculiarly Jewish culture were
harmoniously combined with the attractive forms of
European civilization; indeed, in every respect his
was a perfectly moulded nature. Gifted with genial
humor and wit, enthusiasm and discretion, leading
an ideal life, and possessing a sure practical
instinct, endowed with poetic talents and sober
thought, with childlike tenderness and cutting satire,
great eloquence and earnest vigor, deep love of
Judaism and delight in modern ideas&mdash;he combined
these varied characteristics in the happiest manner.
These brilliant qualities, together with his nobility
of soul and disinterestedness, devotion to his convictions,
and conscientiousness in all official duties,
his delicacy of feeling, tact, aversion to vulgarity
and forbearance with the vulgar&mdash;swiftly captivated
all hearts, attracted the noble-minded, and even
filled the unworthy with respect, and thus lightened
his labors. Born and bred under the mild Danish<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_579" id="Page_579">579</a></span>
government, which at an early date had granted
equal rights to Jews, nor, like other states, withdrew
or abridged them when circumstances changed,
Mannheimer from childhood learned to hold his
head high, and to represent his co-religionists and
utter his convictions without fear even in a country
where a servile conception of the position of burgesses,
peasants, and especially of the Jews, long
prevailed. Mannheimer did not possess original
ideas or deep knowledge of Jewish literature; but
he was powerfully swayed by his own convictions,
which he cherished and disseminated, not hiding
them away as buried treasures. This man of words
and action was placed by destiny in a situation,
where his peculiar nature and special gifts could
find scope, and ennoble wide circles. Everyone
cognizant of the state of affairs then prevailing in
Austria, and the extent to which the Austrian Jews
have since progressed, must confess that Mannheimer
was providentially fitted for his position in
the Austrian capital, on the boundary-line of semi-barbarous
countries, to raise the Jews of those
lands from the moral degeneracy into which they
had been plunged as much by Joseph II's benevolent
despotism as by his mother's hostility, and to
repair the harm caused by the Herz Hombergs, the
Peter Beers, and the whole troop of so-called
"Normal teachers" and official religious instructors.</p>

<p>A chief who, in face of constant strife and danger,
founds a colony with a band of half savage men,
elevates it, and trains it to be a pattern to others,
can claim no greater praise than Mannheimer
deserved in founding the congregation of Vienna.
The camp of Metternich and Francis I tolerated no
Jews within its domains; only by way of exception
a few rich families with their dependents were
tolerated under various extraordinary titles. These
favored families had immigrated from various
countries, were in no way connected, had no rights<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_580" id="Page_580">580</a></span>
as a community, could not possess a synagogue,
nor appoint a rabbi; in short, by law almost everything
was forbidden to them as a religious body.
Nevertheless, certain adventurous persons amongst
them desired to introduce a German order of service,
founded on the model of the Hamburg Temple,
and their efforts were alternately encouraged and
frustrated by the government. When these
enlightened men in Vienna undertook to build a
Temple, they secured the aid of Mannheimer as
preacher (June, 1825), but were compelled to evade
the restrictive laws by inventing some insignificant
title for him, so that he might be allowed to reside
in Vienna.</p>

<p>Although Mannheimer was intimate with David
Friedl√§nder, Jacobson, and the young iconoclasts
with whom destruction of the old Judaism was a
principle, and had occasionally preached in the
Reform synagogues of Berlin, Hamburg, and Leipsic,
yet he was not so strongly attached to the new system
that he did not recognize its fundamental errors.
His first and his last word in his new sphere of
action was that no rupture should be caused between
Jews, no sectarianism should be encouraged, and
that the old orthodox party should not be offended
and repelled by daring movements, but should
gradually be won over to the new forms. Actuated
by these ideas, he carried a moderate change in the
synagogue service, in opposition to the wishes of
the man who had promoted him to his office.
Mannheimer in the new synagogue removed only
offensive excrescences, making the service dignified,
and animating it by his impressive words, but he retained
the Hebrew language, that strong bond of
union, and, to the regret of his former brother reformers,
dispensed with the organ and German hymns.
Even more successfully than Isaac Bernays did
Isaac Mannheimer pave the way to the reconciliation
of old and new ideas.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_581" id="Page_581">581</a></span>
In his pulpit eloquence, acknowledged by competent
judges, Jews and Christians, to be of high
quality, his power of harmoniously combining two
apparently hostile elements was displayed. Mannheimer
had discovered a noble treasure in Jewish
literature and profited richly by it. In the Talmud
and Agada&mdash;a mine of thoughtful sayings, parables,
riddles, interesting observations and witty play upon
words&mdash;he made himself thoroughly at home, discovered
the golden grain, or, to speak more
accurately, knew how to extract a pleasing meaning
from the most insignificant saying, and employed
the remarks of the old Agadists as interpreters of
new views and thoughts. By utilizing the Agadic
elements, his method of preaching acquired a peculiar
character, and exercised strong attraction over the
pious Jews and the rising generation. Portuguese
Jews (Franks), who had migrated from Turkey to
Vienna, also listened with pleasure to this
lively and spirited preacher. The East and West
were united in Mannheimer and in the new Viennese
Temple, consecrated April, 1826. As if the congregation
of this Temple were intended from the
outset to complete the work of propitiation between
old and new forms, they succeeded in securing the
services of Sulzer, a skilled musician, who with his
wealth of musical resources endowed the Hebrew
prayers with almost magical expressiveness, and
transformed the old objectionable intoning into soul-stirring
melodies. These melodies rendered an
organ superfluous. The soft, swelling chorals and
solos of the Viennese Temple, as also Mannheimer's
sermons, proved that the old possessions were not
utterly useless, as violent reformers had represented
them to be, but only required modifying to be impressive.
Pulpit and choir, working in accord, produced
great effect upon the minds of the growing congregation
of Vienna, whose affection for inherited
Judaism, and reverence for Jewish antiquity were<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_582" id="Page_582">582</a></span>
combined with a desire to satisfy the demands of
progress. Mannheimer's personality served to
strengthen the feeling so awakened. In the pulpit,
as in household and social affairs, he appeared, not
as a guardian of souls, as a clergyman, or priest&mdash;he
abominated a sanctimonious, unctuous manner&mdash;but
as a tender father, as a friend, adviser, and help.
As he did not shrink from censuring the objectionable
side of old and new customs, he educated,
by word and example, a pattern community in which
each individual strove to maintain peace and suppress
dissension.</p>

<p>It was in Vienna that the subservient humility
of the Jew was first turned into self-respect, and
this in spite of the political oppression which lasted
until the year of the Revolution. The aversion
felt by the barbarous Polish Jews to civilization
gradually disappeared, giving way to a desire
for self-improvement. The Viennese community
thereby obtained historical importance. The tones
that resounded from the pulpit and the choir, stirring
the members of the congregation, awoke a mighty
echo in the near and remote communities of Austria.
Pesth, Prague, and smaller communities in Hungary
and Bohemia followed the impulse given by Vienna,
influenced by the conciliatory manner with which the
"purified divine service" was there conducted, and
the movement commenced in Vienna extended to
Galicia.</p>

<p>The election of Chacham Bernays as head of the
Hamburg congregation, and Mannheimer's activity
in establishing the order of service in the Vienna
synagogue, gradually aroused the emulation of other
German communities. Educated rabbis were
preferred, and they restored dignity to the synagogue.
The German Jews in turn made their
influence felt in France and Italy. The Franco-Jewish
consistories having neglected the favorable
opportunity to be leaders, offered by French supremacy,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_583" id="Page_583">583</a></span>
had to content themselves with being followers.
In Italy those of the communities that belonged to
Austria also felt the impulse originating in Germany,
although sermons in the vernacular or in Spanish
had been delivered there since olden times, and the
divine service, at least outwardly, showed no signs
of neglect.</p>

<p>How great the harm that can be done through
unsoundness of mind or nebulous theories even by
distinguished men, or how, at least, they can nullify
their own efforts, was proved by a striking example
in Berlin, in most remarkable contrast to that in
Vienna. At the time when the learned mob of Germany
were flinging stones at the Jews with the cry
of "Hep, hep!" three Jewish young men met together
to plan a sort of conspiracy against the incorrigible
Christian state, all three filled with earnest
ideals. They pondered carefully the means to be
employed in destroying the deeply-rooted hatred
against Jews in Germany. The first of the three
was Zunz who lived to grow grey in research;
the second, Edward Gans, the champion and
apostle of Hegel's philosophy and the assailant
of the old ways of jurisprudence; and lastly, an
accountant who lived in a literary world, Moses
Moser, Heine's most trusted friend, whom he called,
"The <i>√©dition de luxe</i> of a real man, the epilogue of
Nathan the Wise." They combined (November 27,
1819) for the purpose of founding a "Society for
the Culture and Science of the Jews." Gans, who
was of a mercurial nature, and might have been the
leader of a revolution, was the chief of this movement.
These three young men secured the aid of two others
similarly disposed, who were enthusiastic for science,
freedom, and idealism. The two fossilized Mendelssohnians,
Ben-David and David Friedl√§nder,
also became members of the society, and Jacobson
was ready with advice and assistance. In all it
numbered about fifty members in Berlin; in Hamburg<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_584" id="Page_584">584</a></span>
it owned about twenty of the supporters of the
Temple Union, and a few others scattered in one
place and another. As already mentioned, Heine
afterwards attached himself to it, and worked for its
success.</p>

<p>The first condition made by the founders was that
the members were to adhere faithfully to Judaism, to
withstand bravely the allurements of the Church, and
thus give to the young generation a brilliant example
of constancy and independence. Had it remained
true to this programme, the society would have been
a beneficent factor in the advancement of Judaism,
seeing that most of its members were talented, and
occupied the heights of culture. But it started from
false premises, aimed at results too far removed,
and employed the wrong means to attain the end.
Practical minds were wanting in the society. The
false premise was, that if the Jews acquired solid
culture, devoted themselves to arts and science, and
carried on agriculture and handicrafts instead of
trade, German anti-Semitism would vanish, the sons
of Teut would fraternally embrace the sons of
Jacob, and the state would not deny them equal
privileges. Therefore the society desired&mdash;their
multitudinous wishes seem almost ludicrous&mdash;to
establish schools, seminaries, and academies for the
Jews, to promote trades, arts, agriculture, and
scientific studies, and even educate them in the
forms of polite society. From the idea of founding
academies, however, only a sort of private school
resulted, where the cultured members of the society
taught or caused to be instructed poor youths who
had come to Berlin principally from Poland, students
of the Talmud who escaped from its folios to
learn "wisdom." The founders soon perceived that
they had built castles in the air, and that the Society
for Culture, on account of its pretentious character,
met with no support. They therefore took
up a less exalted position, limiting themselves to<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_585" id="Page_585">585</a></span>
mere agitation, and to the promotion of the science
of Judaism,&mdash;certainly a praiseworthy enterprise
and a pressing necessity. They determined to
deliver discourses in turn, and to establish a journal
for the "Science of Judaism." But the leaders
themselves did not exactly know what was meant
by this term, nor how to commence their work.</p>

<p>Hegel, the profound thinker and great sophist,
the court and church philosopher, introduced these
young Jews, ardent in the pursuit of truth, into the
labyrinths of his method, and confused their minds.
Young Israel, the founders of the Society for Culture,
at first listened to the utterances of this philosophical
acrobat as to oracles. In a parrot-like
manner they repeated after him, that Judaism is the
religion of the spirit, which has given up the ghost,
and that Christianity has united in itself the whole
of ancient history, and radiates its ideas in a rejuvenated,
ennobled form. They also accustomed themselves,
like their master, to walk upon stilts. The
simplest thoughts were presented in distorted
forms, as though they did not wish to be understood.
How, indeed, could feeling for Judaism have awakened
in them? Edward Gans, it is true, was continually
speaking of the "unrelieved pain of
Judaism," but was all the time thinking of himself,
who could not obtain a position in Prussia. What
was the aim of the science of Judaism which this
Society for Culture desired to promote? Gans
expressed it in the hollow phrases of the Hegelian
jargon, and it is apparent that the leader did not
know what cause his followers were to defend.</p>

<blockquote>

<p>"The Jews cannot perish, nor can Judaism be utterly destroyed.
But in the great movement of the whole, it is to seem to have perished,
still it is to continue to live, as the stream lives on in the ocean."</p></blockquote>

<p>The Society desired to assist in demolishing the
wall of separation dividing Jews from Christians,
and the Jewish world from the European. It wished<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_586" id="Page_586">586</a></span>
to abolish every dissimilarity existing between the
Jewish and the universal system.</p>

<p>The journal of the Society for Culture testified to
the uncertainty and obscurity of its aim. Its articles
consisted chiefly of indigestible Hegelian
phraseology, or of learned matter of use to an
exceedingly limited circle as material for further
work. Heine, who called a spade by its name,
bluntly declared to the editor of the journal, "That
the greater part of it is useless owing to its obscure
form."</p>

<blockquote>

<p>"Did I not know by chance what Marcus [one of the contributors]
and Gans are aiming at, I should not understand anything of what
they write.... Insist upon culture of style with your contributors.
Without this, the other culture cannot thrive."</p></blockquote>

<p>Yet with this farrago of nonsense the Society
hoped to elevate not only the Jews, but even Judaism,
and were indignant that the former paid no
regard to their efforts. Gans, in an article giving
an account of their plans, complained that the
founders were not understood. The reproach
which he cast upon the Jews in general was especially
true of the Society for <span class="locked">Culture&mdash;</span></p>

<blockquote>

<p>"Enthusiasm for religion, together with the solidity of ancient
institutions, has vanished, but no new enthusiasm has come to light,
and no new state of affairs has established itself. We have not gone
beyond that negative enlightenment, which consists in despising and
contemning things as they are, without troubling to infuse a new
spirit."</p></blockquote>

<p>This marvel could least of all be brought about
by the Society for Culture, because it was deaf
to the voice of God, which speaks in Jewish history,
in Jewish law from its very commencement,
and in the Jewish people. The Society inveighed
against the whole world, and relieved its feelings in
elegiac effusions. Gans, the chief mover, poured
out his wrath over the rich men in Israel, who
showed no sympathy with his world-awakening
dreams.</p>

<p>Great was the disappointment of the founders of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_587" id="Page_587">587</a></span>
the Society for Culture. Its supporters diminished
rather than increased in number. The journal with
its curiously confused language found no readers,
supplies ran short, and the members themselves
forsook the standard, and in spite of the tacit oath
embraced Christianity. Edward Gans himself
secretly cherished the idea of obtaining a professorship
by means of baptism. The dissensions among
the German Jews, the contemptuous tone in which
the sons of Judaism spoke of their religion, and the
numerous examples of baptism in their midst&mdash;up
to the year 1823 there were no less than 1,236 conversions
in Berlin, comprising half of the members
of the community, and in other parts of Prussia
there were 1,382&mdash;and the pietism of the Prussian
court, brought about the formation in Berlin of a
Society, "For the Promotion of Christianity among
the Jews," which hoped to see the whole body of
the Jews enter the Church. The election of talented
Jews to academic posts was strenuously opposed.
In vain did Hardenberg, the minister, intercede for
Gans, to obtain for him the chair of historical jurisprudence,
which was his specialty. Gans considered
the possibility of becoming baptized whilst
delivering long addresses before the Society for
Culture. The Society dissolved, and at length died
out quietly, uncared for, and unregretted. Gans,
the chief mover, who possessed sufficient wealth to
enable him to remain true to his vow, increased the
number of sceptics and infidels professing Christianity.
This so exasperated Heine, although he
himself was a convert to Christianity, that two
decades later, even after the grave had closed over
him, he could not forgive Gans.</p>

<blockquote>

<p>"The apostasy of Gans was the more revolting, because he played
the part of agitator, and accepted the positive duties of a president.
It is a traditional duty for the captain to be the last to leave the sinking
ship; Gans, however, was the first to save himself."</p></blockquote>

<p>Moser, the second of the triumvirate of the Society
for Culture, remained more steadfast to his<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_588" id="Page_588">588</a></span>
views, although he doubted the possibility of saving
Judaism, and proclaimed the wholesale baptism of
the Jews. The third member of the triumvirate was
the most steadfast, and alone remained thoroughly
true to his word. He was also filled with doubts,
but he did not despair of improvement. He pointed
out how the cure or the completion of the new
revival must commence. "What alone survives
and is imperishable in the midst of this 'Mabul'
(deluge) is the science of Judaism; it continues to
live, even though for centuries no finger has been
raised on its behalf. I confess that next to my submission
to the justice of God, my hope and support
consist in the cultivation of this science. These
storms and experiences shall not so influence me as
to bring me into collision with myself. I have done
what I thought my duty. Because I saw that I was
preaching in a wilderness I ceased to preach, but
not in order to be faithless to the purport of my own
words. There remains naught for the members of
the Society to do, save to remain true, each man to
the work of his own limited sphere, and leave the
rest to God."</p>

<p>If the Society for Culture, which started on its
career with high aspirations, and ended so lamentably,
succeeded in producing only this one result,
stirring up love for the science of Judaism, then its
dreams and attempts have not been entirely vain.
In history not even the slightest seed is wasted;
but no plant could blossom in soil covered with the
dust cast on it by Friedl√§nder and Jacobson in
Berlin. As if smitten with a curse, the spot where
Mendelssohn began the work so full of promise,
nothing could be made to thrive or be of service in
the revival of Judaism. The rabbinical academy,
which the rabbinical assistant in Berlin, in conjunction
with excellent men, desired to call into existence,
never saw the light. From another quite unexpected
quarter, however, there arose the prospect, if not
of salvation, yet of its beginning.</p>

<p>If for a moment fancy is allowed full play, one can
imagine, not only that the houses, utensils, and pictures
excavated from the ruins of Herculaneum and
Pompeii were renewed, but also that the entombed
men were suddenly aroused from their sleep of
centuries, and enabled to collect their thoughts. If
these resurrected Romans could recall their condition
when the catastrophe befell them, could conjure
up before their mind's eye the splendor of their
greatness, remember the mighty institutions which
they and their ancestors called into existence, realize
the heroic power which the Roman people
developed, and if they felt the same power still
stirring within them, a not altogether unjustifiable
self-esteem would seize them. This supposition
is no fantastic idea: a nation actually did arise
from the darkness of the tomb, the only example
chronicled in the annals of man. This resuscitated
people, the Jewish race, endeavored at
its resurrection to collect its thoughts and memories,
and recall a vision of its glorious past; feeling
itself to be at once old and young, rich in memories
and lacking in experience, chained to hoary antiquity
by a perfect sequence of events, yet seeming<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_590" id="Page_590">590</a></span>
as if of yesterday. The Jews first examined the
monuments of their intellect, which had influenced
the history of nations, and had brought forth a
wealth of peculiar products. They served as signposts
in the labyrinth of Jewish history. That is the
science of Judaism&mdash;a vivid realization of its great
history, and its peculiar doctrines. This effort of
memory is not merely an amusing game, a pleasant
pastime, the satisfaction of a desire for knowledge
akin to curiosity, but an irresistible impulse of self-examination.
It aroused the dormant strength in
the breast of the inquirer, and inspired him with
self-confidence to act in the future as in the past.
Self-consciousness&mdash;the consciousness of being the
people of God&mdash;was awakened in this old, resuscitated
nation, and it at once entered into competition
with the young nations, to assert its peculiar
powers.</p>

<p>But history has not yet gone so far: it only shows
that self-respect was awakened; that the Jews no
longer blush for their origin and confession; no
longer hesitate when questioned about them; no
longer, from false shame and their own evil plight,
take a false step, pretending belief in a faith certainly
more distasteful to them than to those born
therein. As if this feeling of self-esteem were to
be particularly favored by the generative force of
history, there arose from the midst of the Jewish
nation artists of great ability&mdash;artists in tone and
color, and poets of the first rank, who by their
steadfastness secured public recognition for their
race. This self-respect of the Jews was the outcome
of political maturity, the latter in turn being
due to the wonderful inventions and the increase of
general intelligence during the last decades, but
it has chiefly been awakened, strengthened, and
fostered by the science of Judaism and the achievements
of talented Jews in connection therewith.</p>

<p>Although the history of this period is still in progression&mdash;at<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_591" id="Page_591">591</a></span>
many points touches the fleeting present&mdash;and
its results cannot be summed up like
those of bygone days, yet the fact cannot be denied
that the aim of Jewish life has been the attainment
of those two precious acquirements&mdash;self-reliance
and self-knowledge. These qualities are intimately
connected, the one completing and promoting the
other. Knowledge of their own experiences and
of history enabled the Jews to make a careful,
unprejudiced study of the origin and growth of their
nationality, and of the peculiarity of their teaching,
and to hide and ignore nothing. Insight into their
own doctrines increased their self-reliance, and
induced them to remove the burdens assumed by
the generations that had lived under oppression.
The struggles in which the Jews had just been
engaged to secure civil, political, and social equality
and to bring about the reformation and refinement
of Judaism, stand in closest connection with these
two qualities&mdash;on the one hand, with the better
appreciation of their own nature, on the other, with
their growing self-reliance&mdash;influencing them, or
being influenced by them.</p>

<p>Step by step the mountain heaps of obstructive
rubbish had to be cleared away, an open space cut
out, new building materials procured or collected,
before it was possible, to think, not of putting the
crowning stone to the edifice, but of erecting the
frame of the structure. Unconsciously the entire
generation, many members of which are still active,
set to work upon this gigantic task, which had not
been dreamed of fifty years before, still less considered
in any way practicable. Deep but almost
unconscious attachment to Judaism on the part of
enthusiastic spirits enabled them to attain a goal
which must be regarded as a marvel by posterity,
even though it has itself advanced beyond it. Jewish
science by laborious research and investigations
has developed three important points: the course<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_592" id="Page_592">592</a></span>
of Jewish history in its long chain of events and its
significance, the precious basis of Jewish teaching in
all its bearings, and, finally, the enduring faculty of
the Jewish race, which defied so many persecutions,
rendered certain qualities hereditary, accomplished
such wondrous miracles of history, and was the
means of bringing salvation to the world. These
three aspects, the comprehension of history, of the
tenets of Judaism, and of peculiar nationality, were
developed one after the other. Each of these
branches of knowledge had to be pursued from its
commencement, and followed through a long course,
and if not brought to a conclusion, it at least
reached a state in which it could be clearly grasped
and understood.</p>

<p>All nations desirous of asserting their independence
and vitality seek to prove their age: they
interest themselves in remembrances of the past,
and bring to light their ancestral portraits and their
armorial bearings, to demonstrate that they have
passed through the vicissitudes of fortune and misfortune,
the alternations of strength and weakness,
victory and defeat, that they have given evidence
of intellectual capacity, and therefore may lay claim
to continued existence and development. The
Jewish people had no need to make search for their
famous exploits or the monuments of their intellectual
powers; even in their apparently servile condition
these were not wanting. Each century proclaimed
this fact to the next, and it was only
needful to give ear to, or not wholly to disregard
this voice amid a crowd of selfish interests. The
history of the Jews naturally bore most eloquent
testimony to the people's greatness; but it was not
easy to present it in its brilliancy. The history of
the Jewish nation had been distorted by the thousand
unjust prejudices of the ages. Under the cruel
persecutions of their tormentors, the Jews could not
retain the accumulated reminiscences of their great<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_593" id="Page_593">593</a></span>
past; they knew them only in distorted fragments.
Christian scholars, attracted by the grandeur of the
theme, had indeed formed these disjointed fragments
into a picture; but it could not be a true one,
seeing that many component parts were wanting.
The bright colors had faded, and there was a preponderance
of shadow, perhaps intentionally placed
there. Even to well-disposed defenders of the
Jews, like Dohm and Gr√©goire, who had zealously
studied the annals of Jewish history, they did not
give a clear idea of its course. More than a century
had elapsed since the worthy French Protestant
clergyman, Basnage, after diligently studying
Jewish history, had given to the world his somewhat
fragmentary researches, when the wife of an American
clergyman, Hannah Adams, of Boston, struck
by the marvelous fate of the Jewish nation, delineated
their history from the time of the return from
Babylon to recent days. For many reasons she
was not qualified to give an intelligible outline of
Jewish history, but could only string together a
number of rough sketches without connection or
sequence. This crude work, nevertheless, was
good enough for the purposes of the London Society
for the Promotion of Christianity among the
Jews, which besides made several alterations in the
book in order to serve its ends. Fidelity to history
and truth were entirely disregarded in the changes.</p>

<p>It was high time for Jews to take away the historian's
pen from the hands of Christians who only
trifled with it. However feeble might be their first
attempts, and inadequate though their conception
of the peculiarity of Jewish history was, yet it was
meritorious to remove the Christian seal, impressed
upon it by unconscious forgers, in order to claim it
as the property of the Church. The first Jew who
bore in his heart the great characteristics of the
history of his race, and in part published it, deserves
a place of honor. He was a talented youth whose<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_594" id="Page_594">594</a></span>
early death was due to insanity, so often the mark
of a true poet. Solomon L√∂wisohn (born in Moor,
Hungary, 1789, died 1822) had succeeded under
most unfavorable circumstances in acquiring secular
culture, and thereby had qualified himself to appreciate
the value of his nation's treasures. L√∂wisohn
had a much truer comprehension of the beauty and
sweetness of Hebrew poetry, of its sublimity and
simplicity, than Herder, because he was better
acquainted with it. He regarded the history of his
people from the standpoint of poetry, as from that
of faith. In his "Lectures upon the Modern History
of the Jews," from their dispersion till the
present day, he succeeded in unrolling a charming
picture. He also distinguished certain important
points, and correctly showed the lines to be followed,
to avoid losing oneself in this apparent chaos.</p>

<p>Jewish history assumed a better form in the hands
of Isaac Marcus Jost (born at Bernburg, 1793; died
at Frankfort-on-the-Main, 1860). He had greater
courage than a more gifted contemporary, and
although not possessed of sufficient resources he
undertook the gigantic task, and he deserves credit
for having pointed out a way through the vast labyrinth.
When the bigoted Teutomaniacs desired to
banish the Jews from Teutonic soil, and the Jew-haters
searched the pages of history for an excuse
to slander them, Jost determined to show them in
a better light. He desired to prove that they had
always been peaceful citizens and faithful subjects.
They had certainly opposed the Roman Emperors,
and had maintained a vigorous war against them,
but this was the act of a few boisterous brawlers,
whose folly should not be visited upon the entire
people. On the whole, the Jews had proved themselves
honest men, who had not slaughtered
Christian children, nor in any way deserved the
reproaches leveled against them. Only the Pharisees
and their descendants, the rabbis, detestable men,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_595" id="Page_595">595</a></span>
filled with superstition, darkness, and arrogance, had
made hell hot for the people, the property of the
rabbis. This is the basis of Jost's delineation of
Jewish history. He wished to confute at the same
time the admirers and the antagonists of Jewish
history. No one at the present day can deny the
one-sidedness of his representation. Nevertheless
Jost performed a real service to his people by his
historical labors. He offered something new to his
age, and as accurately as possible laid down the indispensable
foundations of history&mdash;time and space.
He cannot be reproached for utilizing the sources
of history without having investigated them; his
generation was not endowed with the faculty of carefully
testing historical evidences. Jost's "History"
proved a good guide and instructor to statesmen
engaged in the amelioration of the condition of the
Jews.</p>

<p>But the main objection to Jost's narrative cannot
be disregarded, seeing that even in his old age, and
in spite of instructive criticism, he stubbornly
pursued his method. He gave to Jewish history,
undeniably heroic, a dry, Philistine character, despoiling
it of the brightness with which it was endowed
even in the eyes of unprejudiced Christian observers.
He tore to shreds the heroic drama of
thousands of years. Between the old Israelites, the
ancestors and contemporaries of the Prophets and
Psalmists, and the Jews, the disciples of the rabbis,
Jost hollowed out a deep chasm, making a sharp
distinction between them, as if the latter were not
the descendants of the former, but of entirely different
stock. And why? Because Jost, the pupil
of Friedl√§nder and Jacobson, denied all miracles,
not only those involving changes in the laws of
nature, but also such as are brought about through
inspiration and steady endurance, the miracles of
history, arising out of the peculiar combination of
circumstances, blow following on blow, reaction on<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_596" id="Page_596">596</a></span>
action. He saw in history only an accumulation of
contingencies subject to no law. Therefore the
Jews were not to be considered the sons of the
Israelites, nor the rabbis the successors of the Prophets,
nor the Talmud the outcome of the Bible,
otherwise the intervention of miracles had to be
conceded.</p>

<p>In Europe, which had fallen into a state of almost
glaring stupidity, there now occurred a historical
marvel which caused a sensation from one end of
the continent to the other. From the serene sky in
the West there came a lightning flash; a thunderclap
and terrifying crash followed, as if the end of
the world had come&mdash;the Revolution of July (1830)
was indeed a miracle. No one had expected it,
or was prepared for it. Even the men who brought
it about, and fought in it, were impelled by some
dark feeling, were not aware of the force of their
actions, were only the blind agents of the Ruler of
history.</p>

<p>This revolution affected the Jews and consequently
Judaism, like every important change in history.
The equalization of the Jews in France, although
sealed by the constitution, had suffered somewhat
under the two Bourbons, Louis XVIII and Charles
X, as the nobility and the Catholic clergy were
possessed of great influence, and the officials
understood their hint not to be too friendly to the
Jews. The reactionary Catholic clergy began to
renew their intolerance towards the Jews, and the
police displayed hostility to the Jewish ritual. Had
the Bourbons been able to gratify their own wishes
by discrediting the constitution as well as liberty
and equality, the French Jews would have been the
first victims, and like their German co-religionists
would once more have been placed under exceptional
laws. The July Revolution was thus of
momentous importance to them. The first assembly
of deputies under King Louis Philippe, who desired<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_597" id="Page_597">597</a></span>
to execute the Charter, at once considered the
abolition of all existing inequalities, however slight,
between Jews and Christians. One of the deputies,
Viennet, proposed (August 7, 1830) to remove
from the constitution the recognition of a state
religion. His proposition was supported on all sides.
A few months later (November 13) the minister
of public education, M√©rilhou, brought forward a
motion to place Judaism upon an equal footing with
the other two creeds, to pay salaries from the public
treasury to the Synagogue and the rabbis, as well as
to the Church and its ministers. He praised the
French Jews, saying that since the removal of their
disabilities by the Revolution they had shown themselves
worthy of the privileges granted them. He
exhorted the deputies to agree to the law of equality
for the three creeds. His motion was adopted by
a large majority.</p>

<p>In the chamber of peers it was more difficult to
pass the law decreeing the equality of Judaism and
Christianity. The advocates of the motion were
eloquent in their recognition of Jewish virtues.
The names of those Jews who had left behind them
a glorious reputation in history were mentioned,
such as Philo, the representative of Jewish philosophy
in ancient times; Maimonides, of that of "the Middle
Ages and modern days"; Mendelssohn, "the sage,
whom philosophic Germany was in the habit of
comparing with Plato."</p>

<p>When the division was taken in the chamber of
peers (January 1, 1831), the law for the complete
equalization of the Jews was carried by 89 votes to
57. Thus the last barriers between the adherents
of Judaism and their Christian neighbors were
removed in France. King Louis Philippe, on the
8th of February, ratified the law, which enacted that
the French rabbis, like the Catholic and Protestant
clergymen, should receive part of their salary from
the public exchequer. The High School (Coll√®ge<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_598" id="Page_598">598</a></span>
Rabbinique) for the training of rabbis, which a short
time before had been founded in Metz, was also
recognized as a state institution, and partly supported
from the public budget. At the same time, the
Senate at Frankfort-on-the-Main brought forward
a motion to grant civil rights to the Jews, particularly
abrogating the limitations to marriage. But
of the 90 members of the legislative body, two-thirds
voted against it.</p>

<p>The shock caused by the events of July, which
was felt also in Germany, awakened a feeling of
self-dependence; it dispelled all timidity and false
shame in speaking about Jews and Judaism, which
had hitherto been avoided, as if a loud word would
have precipitated the avalanche of Jud√¶ophobia
with destructive force. Even Jews belonging to
so-called good society, who, for the sake of some
material advantage, had been anxious to have people
forget that they were members of an oppressed
race, and had preferred to conceal or ignore the
injustice done them, began to appreciate their own
worth and ceased to be ashamed of being recognized
as Jews. This change of sentiment manifested in
different ways, like every change, was brought about
by influential personalities.</p>

<p>Gabriel Riesser (born 1806, died 1860), a man of
noble mind and great energy, took a prominent
part in awakening this self-respect. However
bitter the complaints of the German Jews of the
disgrace brought upon them by immigrant Polish
Jews, they were amply compensated by Riesser.
His spirit of firm determination he derived more
from his maternal grandfather, Rabbi Raphael
Cohen, who had emigrated from Poland, than from
his weak, good-natured German father. Gabriel
Riesser in every respect belonged to modern times.
Unlike most of the promoters of the new spirit, he
was not rooted in the old order of things. His
thoughts, feelings, and dreams were German, and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_599" id="Page_599">599</a></span>
only slight traces of his Jewish origin are perceptible.
To Judaism in its national form, as the leaven
of history, Riesser was indifferent; only the recollections
of his youth and his parental home bound
him to the faith. Beyond that, he looked upon
it as an attenuated system of diluted doctrines,
which he tacitly professed without desiring to
defend them. He suspected, however, that Judaism
might continue to flourish in a rejuvenated healthy
form, though he did not define clearly wherein this
revival should consist. To promote it was altogether
outside his sphere. Had he not been hampered in
his chosen vocation, he would have been a quiet
German citizen, a conscientious judge or lawyer,
without troubling himself to improve the world or
rectify a corrupt state of affairs. German Jew-hatred
roused him to defend the derided cause of his
fellow-sufferers. His first work as a jurist attracted
attention, and he tried to become an attorney in his
native town, but was rejected. He next sought to
deliver lectures upon jurisprudence in Heidelberg,
but the professor's chair was refused him likewise.
His gentle, peaceable nature revolted against such
foolish exclusions. Thus Riesser, who felt no
particular call to work for the general good, was
driven to become an agitator, not alone for the
freedom of his co-religionists, but also for that of
the whole German nation. He made it his duty
in life to secure equal privileges for the Jews,
and to defend them whenever attacked. "The
unspeakable sufferings throughout two centuries
of many millions of persons who patiently waited
for deliverance" weighed heavily upon him. His
ideal was Lessing. In his first pamphlet (1831) he
spoke with conscious pride, not alone against German
rulers, but against the people, who refused permission
to the Jews to ascend even the lowest rung
on the ladder of distinction. Nor did he spare his
co-religionists who, on account of superior education<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_600" id="Page_600">600</a></span>
and social position, contemptuously looked
down upon the mass of Jews, and were ashamed of
the name of Jew. "If unjust hatred," he exclaimed,
"clings to our name, should we not, instead of
denying it, rather use all our strength to secure
honor for it?" He contributed freely towards the
removal of the contempt cast upon this name.
Riesser aimed chiefly at defending the honor and
dignity of the Jews. No selfish attainment of
advantages withheld stimulated his action; but a
desire to take part in the unceasing contest between
freedom and oppression, justice and injustice, truth
and falsehood. Filled with indignation he openly
represented to the German rulers that the reason
for depriving the Jews of their rights as men was
the hope that they might thereby be induced to
accept baptism. He also reproached the faint-hearted
Jews who, having a comfortable position,
separated themselves from the main body of their
brethren, or by a false confession purchased equality,
or handed over their children to the Church to
smooth their path through life. Riesser desired to
see societies established which should energetically
work for the emancipation of the Jews. Sympathizers
were to be united in a kind of covenant that, from
a sense of honor, they might remain true to their
fellow-sufferers, until the contest was decided. Ten
years previously the Berlin Society for Culture had
not dared to publish such a programme. But between
Edward Gans and Gabriel Riesser came the July
Revolution. Riesser also invited Christians to join,
inasmuch as it behoved well-disposed men of every
belief to participate in the release of an enslaved
people.</p>

<p>Riesser's words produced their due effect; they
came at an opportune moment, when men's minds
had become susceptible. His mild though determined
utterances made a deeper impression than
B√∂rne's with their incisive keenness. The tone of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_601" id="Page_601">601</a></span>
positive certainty with which Riesser foretold the
ultimate victory of liberty infused hope into every
heart. Various favorable events which now took
place appeared to put a seal on his prophecy. For
the first time the question of the emancipation of
the Jews began to be discussed in the English
Parliament, and the chief leaders in the House of
Commons were in favor of the removal of the
disabilities. A resolution was passed in the Electorate
of Hesse, the first German province to
legalize the emancipation of the Jews. This gave
Riesser courage to pursue his ideal further. He
was indefatigable in his efforts for the cause to
which he had devoted his life, but he kept in view
the honor and credit to be obtained, more than any
desire for material gain. Not even the most unimportant
ceremony might be sacrificed to obtain
rights of citizenship, if they could be procured only
at such a cost; a rule which he most emphatically
laid down on two occasions.</p>

<p>The Jews of Baden, as a token of their gratitude,
presented him with a beautifully designed picture by
the Jewish painter Oppenheim, which artistically
depicted the transition period in Jewish life, the
separation of the old and the new. It was called
"The Return of the Jewish Warrior," who is represented
as surprising his parents and family in the
repose of the Sabbath. In his letter acknowledging
this gift, Riesser remarked, "The father is foolish
who wishes to wrap his son in the garments of antiquity
... but wanting in dignity is the son
ashamed of his father, the generation ashamed of
the past." This deeply-rooted feeling was communicated
to the younger generation with the more
intensity, because it proceeded, not from an official
representative of Judaism, but from a lawyer whose
being was pervaded by the German spirit. Riesser
made the emancipation question popular by his
contest with the Jud√¶ophobists Paulus, Edward<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_602" id="Page_602">602</a></span>
Meyer, Pfizer, Streckfuss, and other driveling enemies
of freedom in the German Assemblies of the
estates, who utilized the contempt attached to the
Jews to bring the whole struggle for liberty into
disrepute. Riesser further managed to have the
Jewish question placed on the programme of the
liberalists. Young Germany, and all who took part
against oppression, were thenceforth compelled to
inscribe religious liberty and the equality of all
classes upon their banner, however great might be
their antipathy against the Jews. But Riesser performed
a far greater service, by rousing a feeling
of dignity in the Jews, and destroying that false
shame which so-called cultured people felt at the
name of Jew. The sincerity of his convictions and
the genuineness of his sentiments, as evinced in
every stroke of his pen, opened all hearts to him.</p>

<p>At this time men of commanding intellect were
not to be found in great numbers among the Jews;
but the younger generation was rich in men of character
who, as it were, compensated for the losses
occasioned by the Berlin Society for Culture. One
of these sterling characters was the bosom friend
of Riesser, a physician, Solomon Ludwig Steinheim
(born, Altona, 1790; died, Z√ºrich, 1866). His was
a highly gifted nature, which dwelt upon the sunny
height of thought; and from this eminence the foolish
pursuits of the multitude appeared like mist formations,
blown hither and thither by the wind.</p>

<p>In Steinheim was revealed, in all its splendor and
all its powers of redemption, the Jewish thought&mdash;without
which Judaism were merely a thousand
years' dream&mdash;that the Jewish people has a gigantic
mission, with which its teachings and fortunes are
in consonance. This idea may have been unconsciously
aroused in Steinheim by Isaac Bernays.
Together with his wealth of thought, Steinheim was
skillful in clothing his ideas in an interesting form,
and adorning them with his rich gifts of eloquence.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_603" id="Page_603">603</a></span>
He might be compared to Jehuda Halevi, the Castilian
poet-philosopher, had he been gifted with
higher poetical talents. His first production, "The
Songs of Obadiah ben Amos in Exile," displayed
germs of the fruitful seed of thought which he disseminated.
A Jewish sage, Obadiah, in Egypt,
describes to his son Eliakim, supposed to be living
at the time of the Ptolemies, the different stages of
greatness and abjection through which the Jewish
people were to pass.</p>

<blockquote>

<p>"It is the design of Providence that a weak people, appointed to
proclaim salvation, shall be persecuted, hunted down, and sacrificed
among millions of enemies throughout thousands of years, and nevertheless
continue alive and active. Our ancestors received for themselves
and their descendants the consecrated office of the priesthood.
The family of Jacob, since its beginning, has been alternately
dispersed and gathered together, and thus trained for its vocation."</p></blockquote>

<p>The Jewish people have entered upon their pilgrimage
over the surface of the globe, to scatter
the luminous seeds of pure worship of God and the
ideal of exalted morality. From this moral pinnacle
Steinheim beheld the past and the future of
Judaism in the clearest light. All riddles were
solved, all questions answered; the doctrines and
history of Israel afforded satisfactory and comforting
replies. The priestly mission of Israel was to be
fulfilled through great sufferings; this saviour of
the world was compelled to wear a crown of thorns,
and to be humbled to the condition of a slave.
Steinheim saw the past and the future of Israel as
in a magic mirror, bright, clear, and rich in color.
Only the present was puzzling to him. The
estrangement of the sons of his people from their
origin, their despair of themselves, their contempt
for their teachings and descent, the daily recurring
apostasies and desertion from the flag, appeared to
him as omens of approaching downfall, as though
the high priests of mankind were secularizing themselves,
profaning their sanctity, exchanging their
birthright for a mess of pottage. Such self-estrangement<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_604" id="Page_604">604</a></span>
and self-debasement Steinheim desired to
counteract. He therefore composed his "Songs of
Obadiah in Exile," in which he worked out his
system.</p>

<blockquote>

<p>"Such times are dangerous, when oppression is lessened, but not
altogether removed, or when freedom is near, but not completely
attained. At these periods, to desert the customs of bygone ages is
deemed meritorious and advantageous, while a desire for transitory
benefits gives rise to indifference to the eternal. This is the time for
real lamentation, when every folly is taken seriously, and every
serious thing is considered folly; when mockery is in every mouth,
and insolence and license in every heart, and when, by reason of
satirical laughter, there is no time for serious matters."</p></blockquote>

<p>Steinheim's muse severely rebuked the unthinking
who seceded from the Jewish religion.</p>

<p>He wished, however, not only to reprove, but also
to instruct and convince. He did not address himself
to the prosperous, the contented, and the rich,
but to "youth with its pains and its ardent longings,
its ready sensibility to light and justice." To these
he dedicated his book so fertile in thought, "Revelation
according to the System of the Synagogue"
(February, 1835). Gifted with a philosophical mind,
Steinheim submitted the whole system of the law to
a searching examination, regarding it as the highest
consideration, as the "miracle of miracles," by
which alone the restless inquiring human mind can
arrive at contentment. Boldly he attempted to give
an answer to the question: What is this highly-praised
and deeply-scorned Judaism? All Jewish
thinkers had been happy in proving that its fundamental
principles agreed with the axioms of mental
philosophy, or, at least, were not in contradiction
to them. If man were left solely to the guidance of
reason or of natural philosophy, he would find no
clue for his moral actions in the labyrinth of contradictions
and uncertainties. It is, therefore, concluded
Steinheim, a poor compliment to a religion
to say that it is in accord with reason; for the latter
is Chronos consuming his own offspring; building<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_605" id="Page_605">605</a></span>
up with one hand and destroying with the other.
The only religion in accordance with reason is
heathenism, or natural religion, in its various modifications&mdash;the
heathenism which was the origin of
so much mischief to morality, in which "robbers,
thieves, adulterers, and sodomites found their finest
examples in the highest beings." If Christianity
renounces its joint origin with Judaism, the fashion
since Schleiermacher and Hegel, it thereby sinks to
the lowest depths of heathenism. Love and hatred,
Ahriman and Ormuz, Christ and Satan, with all variations
of the opposing principles, the eternal substance
about which the two powers are ever contending,
and inexorable necessity&mdash;these are the
fundamental ideas of natural religion: man himself
succumbs under the suffering inflicted by necessity:</p>

<div class="poem-container">
<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="iq">"Through eternal, immovable, mighty laws<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Must we all complete the circle of our existence."<br /></span>
</div></div>
</div>

<blockquote>
<p>"Like the gods, so are their priests and sages: like king, like herd."<br /></p>
</blockquote>

<p>In opposition to this sensual or perhaps refined
heathenism comes Judaism with its totally different
mode of thought. It sets up a personal God who
is not identical with Nature, and is not divided into
two principles: it recognizes a "Creatio ex nihilo,"
without an eternal substance. It lays stress upon
free will, consequently upon man's responsibility for
his moral actions. These truths and others have
not been evolved by human reason, nor could they
be so evolved; they had been revealed upon Sinai.
Although they were alien to reason, yet they are so
clear and convincing that it soon accepts them,
displacing the contradictory phases of thought
regarding the perplexing natural phenomena, whose
laws reason cannot explain. Sinai, with its lightning-flashes,
shed both light and warmth over the
world, clearness of thought and moral purity. The
synagogue forms a sharply defined antithesis both<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_606" id="Page_606">606</a></span>
to mythological religion and the church. "Out of
Zion shall go forth the law, and the word of the Lord
out of Jerusalem": with inspired enthusiasm Steinheim
subscribed to these prophetic, half-fulfilled
words. When he had discovered, or thought he
had discovered, the soul of Judaism, Steinheim
became filled with ardent zeal, a striking phenomenon
in a time of sober speculation. This love for
Judaism so illumined his mind and facilitated his
understanding of the past, that he even learned to
value the activity and energy of the greatly despised
rabbis.</p>

<p>In his "Revelation" Steinheim revealed many
truths, or rather, he brought to light ancient truths
which had been ignored or forgotten. No one
either in his own or in the preceding age understood
the fundamental principles of Judaism so
thoroughly as he did, although several of his
hypotheses and inferences cannot be completely
established. He, however, made but a slight impression
upon his contemporaries, although he set forth
the grandeur of Judaism with almost prophetic
inspiration, and in an attractive manner. Whence
came his isolation? It arose from the fact that the
life and actions of Steinheim did not accord with
his thoughts and sentiments. In agreement with
his words, he ought to have become intimately
associated with the Synagogue which from ignorance
"became daily more deserted," to have participated
in its woes and ignominy, to have joined in the
celebration of its days of festivity and sadness, and
to have clothed himself with the pride of those who
were externally slaves, but in their hearts freemen.
But Steinheim did nothing of the kind: he kept
himself aloof from the Jewish community and Jewish
life. What he correctly recognized as the reason
of the resistance to the doctrines of Judaism, "the
simplicity and servile condition of its adherents,"
repelled even him.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_607" id="Page_607">607</a></span></p>

<blockquote>

<p>"The name of the people, which has become its guardian, has
degenerated into a by-word, and now it is demanded that a doctrine
shall be accepted whose supporters are given up to hatred, contempt,
and persecution."</p></blockquote>

<p>To renounce Judaism altogether, like Heine,
Edward Gans, and many others, appeared to
Steinheim dishonorable and wanton; and he therefore
remained externally faithful. But, although he
had recognized the truth that the mission of Israel
consisted in being not only priests, but also sacrifices,
he did not permit this knowledge to influence
his course of life. This was not due to weakness
of character in Steinheim, but to insufficient knowledge
of Judaism in its many-sidedness. In spite of
his predilection for its intellectual treasury, he was
more at home in every other subject than in Jewish
literature.</p>

<p>A deeper knowledge of Judaism was unexpectedly
aroused in a country which cultured Jews like
Riesser and Steinheim were accustomed to despise.
As it was formerly asked, What good can come out
of Galilee? so now it was said, What good can
come out of Poland? Yet, from this very place
there came fruitful seeds which developed into
healthy blossoms. Two men especially, Nachman
Krochmal and Solomon Jehuda Rapoport, profitably
employed the knowledge gained in Germany.
Both seemed destined to fill a gap, to which the
scholars of Jewish science in Germany and France
were unequal. They dug solid ore from the mines
inaccessible in these countries, and showed how to
procure and work it. They stirred up a spirit of
rivalry, which within the short space of three
decades, was instrumental in removing the ruins
covering the great past of Judaism, and in bringing
to light the Divine image hidden beneath. They
were the founders of a new school, which may be
called the Galician.</p>

<p>Nachman Cohen Krochmal (born at Brody, 1785;<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_608" id="Page_608">608</a></span>
died at Tarnopol, 1840), the son of a well-to-do
merchant interested in science, who was accustomed
to make journeys to Germany, caught up the pale,
dying light of the Mendelssohn school. Mendelssohn
was the ideal upon which Krochmal
modeled himself. Married at the age of fourteen,
and transplanted to the little village of Zolkiew,
where the method of instruction so destructive to
science was still in vogue, Krochmal secretly became
absorbed in the study of Hebrew literature. He also
tried to obtain the writings of the German philosophers,
especially of Kant, in order to expand and
clear his mind with earnest thoughts. The more
the strict Talmudists and heretic-hunting Chassidim
of Poland endeavored to discover those who occupied
themselves with works other than the Talmud
or Kabbala, or who read a non-Hebraic book, in
order to denounce them&mdash;the more did Krochmal
and his fellows enjoy their stolen pleasure. Along
with a mass of knowledge from the Talmud, Krochmal
stored up many thoughts of a character hostile
to Talmudism. But open war was never declared.
Krochmal, probably on account of his health,
enfeebled by continued mental activity, was too
timid to venture out of the beaten track: he avoided
disputes, and followed all the superstitiously pious
Polish customs, exaggerating them indeed, in order
not to jeopardize his peace of mind. He was too
earnest and too prudent to overstep the bounds of
habit; nevertheless, he could not altogether escape
suspicion. He had carried on a harmless correspondence
with a Karaite Chacham in the neighboring
village of Kukizow. Certain pious persons knew
this, and represented that he was hatching a conspiracy
against the Talmud with the Karaites.
They obtained one of his letters from the unsuspecting
Karaite, endeavored to extract heresies from
the innocent compliments paid his correspondent
in verse, and spread it throughout the large community<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_609" id="Page_609">609</a></span>
of Lemberg in order to excite the mob
against him. This intrigue greatly affected Krochmal,
and becoming yet more timid and cautious, he
locked up his thoughts within his own breast, and
for a long time could not be induced to publish
anything.</p>

<p>But he revealed the treasures of his mind to his
trusty friends and disciples, not within treacherous
walls, but in the open field. His hearers, schooled
in the Talmud, and accustomed to unravel dark
and difficult problems, quickly understood his hints
without diffuse explanations. By his laconic method
Krochmal could turn everything topsy-turvy, and
unfold a series of investigations, every link of which,
if made public, would have stamped him in the eyes
of his countrymen as a wicked heretic. What made
his method of instruction and his investigations
especially fruitful, was the clearness and finish of
his thoughts, which were arranged in admirable
sequence. Thus his teaching was a wholesome
antidote to the chaotic contradiction and confusion
from which the best Polish minds greatly suffered.
His acquaintance with German philosophy had
schooled his mind, and taught him logical discipline.
Krochmal did not develop original philosophic
thoughts, which he nevertheless seems to have
thought his strong point. He was the first to take
a philosophical view of history, especially Jewish
history, and make a clear survey of its intricacies.
He also pointed out how the mine of the Talmud
could be utilized, and rendered valuable in historical
research. Krochmal himself devoted his attention
to this neglected and little valued literature, and
applied his results to the elucidation of Jewish history.
He succeeded in throwing so much light on
the period from the Babylonian Captivity until the
conclusion of the Mishnah, which Jost and Christian
scholars had completely failed to understand,
that it was an easy task for succeeding inquirers to<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_610" id="Page_610">610</a></span>
follow in his path. He was the first to teach scholars
to examine Talmudical sources of history
through a microscope, or to reproduce half-obliterated
features. This was, indeed, a great gain, and
an immense advance compared with Jost's clumsy
view of history. Krochmal's results do not always
bear investigation, because having no access to
non-Hebraic writings, he was obliged to content
himself with secondary or tertiary sources. But his
acuteness and sincere devotion to this study, did
not allow him to stray from the right track often.
He inspired his disciples to engage in research, and
gave them the key to these hieroglyphic sources.
Although he had not yet published many of his
discoveries, his fame extended beyond the boundaries
of his own country. The community of Berlin,
which since the time of Friedl√§nder had felt deep
aversion to Poles and rabbis, entertained the idea
of calling him as their rabbi. He was considered
one of the leaders of the young science of Judaism,
and had many admirers in Germany.</p>

<p>The most receptive and gifted among his disciples,
Solomon Jehuda Rapoport (born Lemberg,
1790? died Prague, 1867), contested with him for
pre√´minence, and even overshadowed him, partly
by reason of his more fertile productions. Rapoport
was descended from a respected Jewish family,
a race of learned rabbis, one of whose branches had
been transplanted from Italy to Poland. Traces
of his hereditary nobility were apparent in his bearing
and appearance. Of a gentle nature, which
won for him all hearts, having a fund of genial
humor, and of a sociable disposition, Rapoport was
a well-beloved and attractive person in every circle.
These qualities softened the severity of his astonishing
learning. Nothing of especial importance
occurred during his youth. At an early age he was
admitted to the study of the Talmud, and soon was
at home in its labyrinths, owing to his extraordinary<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_611" id="Page_611">611</a></span>
memory and penetrating acuteness. He also married
young.</p>

<p>During his youth, Rapoport became partly false
to Talmudical study, inasmuch as he favored its
rivals&mdash;science and poetry. He has graphically
described the painful path trodden by him and his
peers in order to arrive at the tree of knowledge.
It was difficult to obtain any scientific book, most
difficult to secure one written in a European language.
The index of books prohibited by public
opinion was much more comprehensive than that of
the popes. If one thirsting for knowledge secretly
procured such a book, and it was scented out by the
prying eyes of his relatives or friends, he was
implored to throw it aside, or his friends, on their
own responsibility, confiscated the heretical work,
so as to preserve the student from fanatical persecution
by the Chassidim. Even clear-minded men
were doubtful whether, according to the Talmud,
the study of profane sciences was not forbidden.</p>

<p>Rapoport was not alone in his longing for knowledge.
Here and there, in Galicia, the germs of a
fresh spirit awoke, which struggled hard to remove
the yoke of an unthinking, fanatical public opinion.
Intercourse with Vienna, the Napoleonic wars, in
general, communication with the world, caused
many old forms to fall into abeyance. The spread
of the Chassidistic cult and its presumptuous, outrageous,
and increasingly frantic actions, stimulated
thoughtful, reasonable men to meet it with firm
opposition, for it filled them with passionate hatred,
and drove them to invent expedients whereby to
crush it. The most appropriate method seemed to
be to remove the boorish ignorance in religious and
secular matters and the childlike credulity, by means
of education. Although the Austrian government
had declared it a duty of the Galician congregations
to establish schools, the lower officials had not
shown much zeal in causing this order to be carried<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_612" id="Page_612">612</a></span>
into effect. This neglect was to some extent
advantageous, as the self-deliverance of the Jews
was the more effectual by reason of the struggle
undergone. Since the wars with Napoleon, there
had arisen small circles in the three largest Galician
communities of Brody, Lemberg, and Tarnopol,
banded together for self-culture, the promotion of
education, and a war of annihilation against Chassidism.
The beginning of this movement was made in
Tarnopol by Joseph Perl (born at Tarnopol, 1773;
died, 1839). With great sacrifice of time and
money, and with unswerving perseverance, he
founded a pattern High School for the middle
classes. He made incisive attacks upon the Chassidim
in a work, intentionally written in a corrupt,
barbarous jargon, which was in no way inferior to
"The Letters of Obscure Men" in the monkish
Latin of Rubianus and Hutten, perhaps slightly
more artistic. This bitter enemy of the Chassidim
entered into communication with the Jewish representatives
of education in Germany, and was elected
an honorary member of the Berlin Society for Culture.
In Brody, where Jews engaged in extensive
foreign trade, the rich merchants, who traveled in
Germany and Austria, introduced the desire to imitate
the German Jews. In Lemberg, where Rapoport
lived, a kind of literary circle was founded, at
whose head was a wealthy, highly-cultured man,
Jehuda L√∂b Mises (died 1831). He provided ambitious
young men in Lemberg with money, counsel,
and, what was of especial value to them, with an
excellent library of Hebrew and European books.</p>

<p>From this circle arose an admired scholar, who
deserves a golden page in the records of Jewish
literature. This was Isaac Erter, born in a village
near Przemysl, 1792, and died at Brody, 1851. He
who by means of his magic poetry succeeds in
showing the powers of renaissance dormant in a
so-called dead language, unconsciously also demonstrates<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_613" id="Page_613">613</a></span>
the vitality of the race in whose midst such
artistic creations can arise, and can by many be understood,
and admired. Erter's object was to scourge
the perversity of Polish Judaism, the chaos of superstition
and learning, and the coarseness of the
Chassidim; but by the noble form in which he
clothed his scorn and his righteous indignation he
attested the immortality of the Hebrew language
and people. Born in a wretched Galician village,
he created beautiful Hebrew pictures, such as would
have delighted Isaiah and the most refined Psalmists.
Erter's father, though a poor man, little more
than a peasant, had nevertheless not neglected the
sacred duty of a Jew to have his talented son
instructed in Jewish writings. The Talmud, to be
sure, was the only work with which young Erter
was thoroughly acquainted. Of the beauties of
biblical poetry, like all Jews of Poland at that time,
he had no idea in his youth. When he was thirteen
years old his father imposed the bonds of marriage
upon him, and shortly afterwards, having become a
widower, the boy married a second wife. His second
father-in-law, who had promised to support him,
did not keep his word, and thus Erter tasted the
bread of misery in his youth. To dispel his bitter
cares he joined the merry Chassidim, taking part in
all their follies; but his innate love of the beautiful
made him feel disgust at the sight of their moral
and physical degradation, nor could he believe in
their miracles. A fortunate accident acquainted
him with a cultured man, who introduced him to two
ideals, Maimuni and Mendelssohn, and so he learned
to understand, love, and imitate the highest models,
viz., the prophet Moses and Hebrew literature.
A new spirit was breathed into Erter by this old,
still ever new revelation, working a change in his
views and his relation to Judaism. To increase his
culture Erter betook himself to Lemberg, where he
hoped to find better means for satisfying his thirst<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_614" id="Page_614">614</a></span>
for science. Here he found struggling sympathizers
of his own age, who, like himself, had married
early, had been tortured by material cares, but had
nevertheless directed all their energies to the cultivation
of the mind. Here he met Rapoport, to
whom as the more learned he looked up with reverence.
There was a peculiar charm in the intercourse
of these young knowledge-seekers, each at
once master and pupil. Whatever was beautiful
and true in European literature they elaborated, for
their own use and that of others, in the Hebrew
language, which they employed as if it were a living
language. The difficulties which members of this
circle could not overcome were submitted to the
wise master, Krochmal, and to him they made pilgrimages
to Zolkiew as to a wizard. This intellectually
idyllic life, which they remembered even in
their old age as a golden dream, lasted for three
years. But their occupation with profane literature
and their actions and aims gave great offense.</p>

<p>One day a ban of excommunication (in the name
of Rabbi Jacob Orenstein) was found affixed to the
gates of the synagogue. It was directed against
four men, who were said to teach the young their
heretical views, viz., Rapoport, Erter, Natkes, and
Pastor. The formal excommunication, customary
in olden days, had been forbidden in Galicia since
the time of Emperor Joseph: therefore the zealots
chose this method. At the time when they had
brought Krochmal under the accusation of heresy,
they had determined to make a vigorous onslaught
upon all apostles of culture. But, seeing that the
ban was directed only against these four poor men,
and that they dared not attack the wealthy, respected
Mises, who openly poured ridicule upon Talmudical
Judaism, their cowardice rendered their
zeal ineffectual. The sentence of excommunication
did not have the expected result, and Orenstein was
compelled by the Austrian authorities to withdraw<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_615" id="Page_615">615</a></span>
it. It hardly affected Rapoport, who had a fairly
independent, if somewhat inferior position, and who
had instructed the young gratuitously. In the eyes
of the common people, however, he was a heretic;
but this did not hinder him from becoming district
rabbi of Tarnopol and afterwards chief rabbi of
Prague.</p>

<p>Poor Erter, however, was severely affected,
because he had to support himself and his family
by teaching. Although the rabbi was obliged to
recall the ban, Erter found that many parents did
not care to entrust their sons to him, and he had to
take up his staff and journey to Brody. But he had
his revenge upon Orenstein and the zealots: he
immortalized their bigotry and pettiness by his
poetry. Indignation and anger at being persecuted
by such tormentors forced the pen into his hand,
and gave rise to his masterpieces of delineation.
Erter harmed Orenstein with his poetical thunders
of excommunication more severely than he himself
had been made to suffer, and completely crushed
him. In a poem he represented a court of justice
which determined the value of objects from a standpoint
dissimilar to that of the actual world. Books
of immense size shrink to nothing, because their
contents prove to have been stolen from various
quarters, and the plagiarism is discovered; only the
title-page remaining the property of the author.
This satire was aimed at Orenstein, who had published
a Rabbinical work in many volumes, which he
was said to have adorned with borrowed plumes.</p>

<p>B√∂rne and Heine would certainly never have
credited it, had they heard that, hidden away in
Poland, among the bearded Jews, there lived a
brother artist "as capable of making filigree-work of
finest words, of weaving a wire-net for the souls of
gnats, or pointing a satire so sharp that it could
penetrate through the pores of glass." As they
had improved, refined, and polished the German<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_616" id="Page_616">616</a></span>
language, so Erter improved the Hebrew tongue.
He breathed youthful vigor and freshness into "the
old woman with silvery hair and wrinkled brow, who
showed only traces of her former beauty" (as he
says), made her susceptible to the prevailing influences
of the day, and docile to express new thoughts.
Was Erter a poet? In his prose he was a perfect
poet. In his faithful and touching descriptions,
there is a store of magic poetry and humor, which,
like the offspring of Heine's wit, attracts and
enchains our minds.</p>

<p>Two thousand years after the prophets had
ceased, there arose a voice which sounded at once
familiar and new. And in this intermingling of the
old and the new in Erter's style, which recalls Isaiah
and Heine, there lies an extraordinary charm.
Faithfully translated, Erter's poems would still be
interesting; but the peculiar, indescribable fragrance
of his work would have passed away. In
their original form and color, in the contrast of solemnity
and childlike simplicity, of sublimity and
detailed description, these poetical productions make
an inexpressibly pleasant impression upon minds susceptible
to delicate shades of thought. In perusing
these masterly delineations, one only regrets that
they are not longer, and that this profound artist
left no more than six of these delightful pictures,
and only a few equally beautiful letters.</p>

<p>Like a true poet, Erter had come too late at the
distribution of the world's goods, and had to contend
with poverty. In his thirty-third year, when
he already had marriageable daughters, he began
to study medicine, in order to earn his daily bread
therewith. The time spent in efforts to rejuvenate
the Hebrew language had to be snatched from
sleep, and death hurried him away in the full maturity
of his poetical powers. Erter performed great
services for Judaism. Through his proofs of the
flexibility of the Hebrew language he awakened<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_617" id="Page_617">617</a></span>
fresh love for it, and created a comparatively new
medium for disseminating the young science of
Judaism. His influence upon his contemporaries is
unmistakable. Whilst the Hebrew style of Nachman
Krochmal was rugged, awkward, almost as
stiff as that of the Tibbonides, and reads like a
translation from a foreign language, Rapoport,
Natkes, Jacob Solomon Byk, the Goldbergs, father
and son, and the younger men of the Galician
school, displayed flow of language, fluency, and
ease, which were afterwards misused in rendering
French novels and conceits into Hebrew.</p>

<p>Rapoport accordingly did not stand alone in
Lemberg; he found friends who participated in his
ideas and efforts. It was especially favorable to
the development of his mental powers that Krochmal
served him as a living book, which contained all
worth knowing. From the days of his youth until
far into manhood, for nearly thirty years, Rapoport
made it a practice, at least once a month, to take a
journey from Lemberg to Zolkiew, to visit the bold,
and at the same time timid, philosophical inquirer,
Krochmal, and to enter into intellectual conversation
with him. This intercourse with his gifted
young friend became such a necessity to Krochmal,
that whenever he was engaged in a subject of
research, he sought out Rapoport in Lemberg to
reach clearness by an interchange of ideas. Rapoport
needed only suggestion; he had inborn taste
and love for Jewish history, and as he possessed
both scholarship and keen perceptions, he made
prolific discoveries. In the interchange of thought
between master and disciple, they in company
arrived at important results, and in the end they did
not know from whose mind they had emanated, or
rather they worked together at the solution of
problems. It is therefore perplexing to know
exactly which of the many results of their common
investigations are to be ascribed to the master and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_618" id="Page_618">618</a></span>
which to the disciple. These fruitful conversations
between Krochmal and Rapoport marked the birth
of the science of Judaism on the historical side.</p>

<p>However, despite their combined discoveries, as
soon as both grew to full maturity of intellect, the
respective territories of their research became
distinct. Krochmal had more liking for general and
encyclop√¶dic studies; details served him only as a
confirmation of his theory. Rapoport, on the other
hand, was more interested in minute, especially in
biographical, research; and general studies did not
attract him. In his youth, Krochmal had planned a
survey of the development of thought in Judaism,
bearing upon the varying phases of enlightenment
and obscuration. Rapoport also commenced a work
in his youth, but it was to be a biography of the
most noted representatives of Judaism and its ideas.</p>

<p>As this laborious task demanded a great amount
of time and attention, and as Rapoport was not
master of his own time, the fruits of his researches
ripened but slowly. When, however, he published
in succession five biographies (1829&ndash;31), with great
fullness of luminous detail and suggestion, the pathway
for a thorough knowledge of the internal history
of Judaism and the Jewish race was opened up.
Rapoport proved indisputably and upon strictly
scientific grounds that the great representatives of
Judaism, its leaders, in the Middle Ages, instead of
shunning the light of knowledge, actually kindled
and fed it. He showed that, at a time when
European nations were still steeped in the darkness
of the Middle Ages, the Jews cultivated general
science. Chronology, historical geography, the
history of literature, and other branches important
for the critical investigation of history, which had
hitherto been altogether neglected, or only superficially
treated, were by him first proved necessary
and applied. The acute intelligence with which he
united disjointed facts, and separated others apparently<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_619" id="Page_619">619</a></span>
connected; the critical touchstone which he
applied to distinguish the true from the false, and
facts from legends, produced such suggestive results
that, after Krochmal, he must be considered the
father of Jewish science. All that had been achieved
by Jost and other predecessors vanished before
these researches like superficial talk before a well
digested, well constructed, clearly conceived oration.
What gave these investigations an especial value,
and distinguished them from the productions of
pedantry was the fervor and love with which they
were undertaken. They must, therefore, be regarded
as national performances, not as the products of
idle scholarship. So far as the Jews took an interest
in these labors, they saw themselves reflected in
them, and considered the history of their mental
development as laid down in them as their own
work, or the guiding-line to be followed in future.
Rapoport achieved more in this direction than
Krochmal, because he did not allow himself to be
intimidated by heretic-hunters, and displayed more
manly courage openly to defend the truth recognized
by him as such. The scientific movement within
Judaism, which since his time has continually grown
in force, must be entirely attributed to him. The
spring which pours forth water from its bosom, and
allows it to trickle down among the bushes unseen
is of no significance compared with the broad stream
revealed to every eye, bearing upon its surface large
ships, and with its overflow fertilizing the adjoining
fields. His greatness was recognized, for he was
elected district rabbi of Tarnopol, and shortly afterwards
chief rabbi of Prague. Once again was a
Pole called to Germany, but under what altered
circumstances!</p>

<p>The effects of Rapoport's system of research
soon manifested themselves. A scholar of the first
rank, who slowly piled brick upon brick for the construction
of the inner history of the Jews, one of the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_620" id="Page_620">620</a></span>
triumvirate of the Berlin Society for Culture, finding
consolation in investigation for the disappointment
met with on another field, utilized Rapoport's
results and system of inquiry, to shed light upon
another side of Jewish history. Zunz, in his
"Homilies of the Jews in Divine Worship," reviewed
them in their origin, their growth, their sublimity,
and their degeneration (1832). They portrayed
Judaism from another point of view, and brought
conclusive proofs that the Jews in the Middle Ages
had not been a rough, half-savage horde, as was
asserted by their bitter enemies, in order to calumniate
them and deprive them of their rights of
equality; that they were not a barbarous fraternity
without morals and decency, but an intelligent community
with a culture peculiar to themselves, yet
actively promoting general culture.</p>

<blockquote>

<p>"From the earliest times we find in the constitution of the Jewish
nation measures for upraising men steeped in the trials and errors of
life, or chained down by sensuality and coarse lusts. Sabbath and
festivals, sacrifices and holy convocations, public worship and instruction
in the law, were to afford comfort to the sinner, support to
the weak, and teaching to all, and to preserve a holy flame of faith
and patriotism in the midst of the nation, as in the breast of the individual.
Centuries have since then passed away, the Jews have lost
their independence and their country; but on the downfall of every
institution the synagogue remained as the sole representative of their
nationality. Towards this center their faith was directed, and from
it they obtained instruction for their daily conduct, strength to endure
unheard-of sufferings, and hope for a future dawn of freedom. The
public worship of the synagogue became the standard of Jewish
nationality, the miraculous shield of the Jewish faith."</p></blockquote>

<p>The form of prayers and sermons was traced in
this peculiar work in their manifold shapes from the
boundary line of the Bible period and that of the
Soferim till the time of their perfection, their
decline, and their regeneration. This book was the
first solid, sober, and convincing work, by a Jewish
author, conceived in the spirit of the German scholars'
guild. It displayed an array of facts which
either had been wholly unknown, or inaccurately
known. It therefore made a lasting impression,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_621" id="Page_621">621</a></span>
and in turn was fruitful in suggestions. It occupies
a place of high importance in the edifice of Jewish
science. The "Homilies of the Jews" was devoted
also to the furtherance of two side issues&mdash;the
emancipation of the Jews and the promotion of
reform. In supporting these aims it was carefully
pointed out and emphasized that up to the last century,
in Portuguese and Italian congregations, sermons
were delivered in the vernacular. But these
two movements, emancipation and reform, were
not much advanced, and whatever was accomplished
in these two directions, is in no way due to the
"Homilies of the Jews." But they made scientific
accuracy in the German sense the indispensable
quality of future investigations, and removed the
reproach of superficiality from Jewish authors.</p>

<p>Newly-fledged Jewish science soon created new
organs wherein to express itself. The oldest and
most noteworthy was carried on in Hebrew: it was
called the "desirable vineyard" (Kerem Chemed),
and was founded by Samuel L√∂b Goldberg of Tarnopol,
and during ten years was of great use in
offering the different views of Judaism the opportunity
of expression. The chief topic was Jewish
history; the greatest care was bestowed upon this
subject. In accordance with their ability, knowledge,
or ripeness of intelligence, the contributors
to the "Vineyard" brought great or small offerings,
without expecting any reward or tangible honor.
What university or academy was there to repay their
laborious researches by the bestowal of a professor's
chair or post of distinction? There was not even
a prospect of situations as rabbis for men engaged
in subjects utterly dissimilar, often opposed, to
rabbinical studies. On the contrary, their zeal for
science rendered them unworthy of rabbinical honor
in the eyes of the strictly orthodox. The chief contributors
to the new journal were the leaders of the
Galician school, among whom Rapoport held the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_622" id="Page_622">622</a></span>
first place, although he incurred opposition by his
candid utterances. Encouraged by Rapoport's
example, Krochmal also consented to publish over
his own name single chapters from his encyclop√¶dic
work. The German Jews supplied only two
representatives, both of whom were talented men,
viz., the author of the "Homilies of the Jews" and
the high-minded Michael Sachs, to whom, however
much they differed in their conception of Judaism,
Jewish science is deeply indebted for rich increase.</p>

<p>The little band of Jewish inquirers received reinforcement
from Italy, a country which for a long
time had been buried in slumber, and had taken but
little part in Jewish history. Besides old Reggio,
Rabbi Ghirondi of Padua, Almanzi, a wealthy layman,
and Samuel Vita della Volta, a physician of
Mantua, special prominence is due to Samuel David
Luzzatto (born in Trieste, 1800; died in Padua,
1865).</p>

<p>The self-sacrifice of Jewish inquirers in the Middle
Ages, who in the midst of unspeakable privations
and sufferings had occupied themselves in the
cultivation of their minds, Luzzatto also manifested
as a model for the younger generation. During his
whole life, and although he enjoyed European fame,
Luzzatto and his family suffered through poverty.
Privations, however, did not hinder him from
increasing his knowledge with endurance all the
more heroic because not publicly displayed. To be
poor in Poland, as was the case with Rapoport and
Erter, was not so distressing as to be poor in Italy,
because in the former, requirements were slight,
and contentment on the smallest means was almost
universal; besides, generous, wealthy men saved
the men of science from starvation. But in Italy,
where even the middle class craved comfortable
living, and where indifference to knowledge among
the Jews had reached a high pitch, it is matter for
great surprise that Luzzatto could find, amidst his<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_623" id="Page_623">623</a></span>
struggles for daily bread, the peace and cheerfulness
necessary to accomplish so much for the promotion
of Jewish science. At every discovery, however
trifling, Luzzatto felt childlike pleasure, which
appears strange to an onlooker: it was the self-created
recreation of the martyr, which for a
moment causes gnawing pain to be forgotten.</p>

<p>Luzzatto was not naturally gifted with aptitude
for historical studies. His most conspicuous trait
was enthusiastic love of poetry, Judaism, and
Hebrew literature, and this threefold love became
one within him. But lofty enthusiasm, united with
extraordinarily delicate taste for poetical beauty,
could not compensate for lack of creative power; it
could do no more than make of him a more talented
Wessely. His Hebrew verses, by which he hoped
to re-animate biblical poetry, are blameless in form,
rhythmical, and of Hebraic coloring; but like
Wessely's verses, they lack soul, true poetry. Luzzatto's
Hebrew prose, polished and elegant though
it be, cannot be compared with Erter's magical language.
This he felt, and he was sufficiently just
to award the palm to his Galician fellow-artist.
His deep comprehension of the true art of poetry,
especially of the delicacy of biblical literature, and
his extremely refined taste, opened to Luzzatto
another field of labor, viz., the exposition of Holy
Writ. To purify this treasure from the rust of
thousands of years had hitherto been the task of
strangers, who did not bring to this work proper
appreciation, still less the needful devotion. Christian
Bible exegetes, such as Eichhorn, De Wette,
Gesenius, and others, had pursued the work of
purification in a clumsy manner, and for want of
critical ability had flung away the true ore as dross.
Luzzatto was one of the first Jews in modern days to
devote himself to biblical exegesis. He possessed
a sure instinct for recognizing the true spirit and
beautiful form of biblical literature, and he called<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_624" id="Page_624">624</a></span>
attention to the disturbing elements whilst restoring
the original ones. No one better than he understood
the construction of the Hebrew language,
even to its most delicate points and grammatical
minuti√¶.</p>

<p>In the new Rabbinical College of Padua (the
Collegio Rabbinico) Luzzatto found opportunities
of engaging zealously in the study of the Bible, and
of ascertaining the correct meaning of the words of
the prophets and inspired writers. If Luzzatto
with his happy feeling for language and his Jewish
fervor had remained true to this branch of research,
he would have produced splendid results, and he
might have performed a substantial service to Jewish
science, for he would have invited many disciples,
inasmuch as his orthodoxy was unimpeachable.
But he was suddenly frightened by his own
boldness, or rather feared that he might misuse it.
If the walls of the Massorah are torn down, he
feared, the sacred text will become the prey of
incompetence and unending revolution, causing
direst confusion. He did not trust criticism to heal
the wounds it inflicted, or rather he did not believe
that it effected a cure by administering poison.
He therefore took up an equivocal position, and
re-erected the outworks of the Massorah, which he
himself had undermined.</p>

<p>Roused by the achievements of Rapoport in history,
he plunged into that study, and produced
important results. Owing to the dispersion of the
Jews and their tragic fate, the fairest pages of their
history during the Franco-Spanish epoch had been
lost. Luzzatto's zeal was kindled to discover these
pages, and in Italy his efforts were crowned with
success. The persecuted Jews from Spain and
France had mostly passed through Italy in their
flight. Here, therefore, the greater part of Jewish
literary treasures had been deposited, but they were
buried from fear of the Argus-eye of the bloody<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_625" id="Page_625">625</a></span>
Inquisition. Luzzatto unearthed them, published
them in scientific organs or as separate works, and
so made them available. Through him the Jewish
history of the Middle Ages received its authentication,
its firm basis, its coloring, and exposition. If
Krochmal and Rapoport are the fathers of Jewish
history, then Luzzatto was its mother.</p>

<p>Through him it became possible to obtain a clear
understanding of facts hitherto only vaguely depicted,
to arrange them in proper groups, and discern their
original splendor. The beginnings of neo-Hebraic
poetry, its flourishing period in the time of Jehuda
Halevi, and in general the prolific mental activity of
the Jews of Spain, were first set forth by him. And
to his last breath Luzzatto was untiring in his
researches and investigations. He collected a
number of valuable works, and stimulated other
friends of Jewish science to do the same. Unstintingly
he permitted the use of his discoveries, and was
happy when he could benefit the public by his newly
found treasures. He was a priest in the service of
Jewish science, and his memory will never be forgotten
in the House of Israel.</p>

<p>Next to the Hebrew organ of Jewish science
(Kerem Chemed), various German journals were
started, which, besides dealing with the topics of
the day, treated of Jewish scientific studies, and
popularized them. One of these organs, "The
Scientific Journal," from its very commencement
assumed an over-confident tone, as if desirous of
setting itself up as the highest tribunal, before which
all efforts should await final judgment. And yet,
most of its contributors, unless proved in other ways,
learned by teaching. Those still among us must
confess, if they are sincere, that on beginning their
undertaking, instead of being at the head of Jewish
science, they were mere tyros, possessing only a
superficial smattering, and that the Galician school
was their guide.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_626" id="Page_626">626</a></span>
The soul of the periodical was its founder,
Abraham Geiger (born 1810; died 1874), a man of
considerable talents, of clear intellect, penetrating
sagacity, comprehensive knowledge, and stern character,
bordering almost upon obstinacy and defiance.
He was also of a weak disposition, and was easily
led, and this quality helped to change what had
hitherto caused only differences of opinion concerning
Judaism, into the harsh extreme of a split
amongst various sects. Although born and bred in
a family schooled in the Talmud, Geiger became
filled with burning hatred towards it, and seeing
that the religious life of the Jews had been hitherto
regulated by the Talmudical standard, he regarded
it as the aim of his existence to bring about its
deposition and to introduce reforms of a radical
nature, outstripping those of his predecessors. The
reform of Judaism was Geiger's chief desire; and to
further it, he used his influence as a preacher and
his scientific researches. He felt no respect for
antiquity or for religious practices, and never spared
those co-religionists who adhered to traditional
customs. He did not shrink from effecting the
most thorough-going schism and disunion. Geiger's
scientific labors did not produce lasting results, as
he cared less for inquiries after truth than for plans
of reform. His journal, however, succeeded in
inculcating self-reliance and self-knowledge. It
courageously attacked the shameless presumption
of sciolist Jew-haters like Hartmann, and inveighed
against weak-minded Jews who attributed all ideals
to Christianity. It may be reckoned to the credit
of this periodical or this school, that it recalled
neglected, because despised, personages, the Karaites,
those talented sceptics and hypocrites.</p>

<p>Through the impetuosity of the new school, life
and action were brought into Jewish circles, and the
results of research were diluted and made popular.
Who can say now whether the gain or the loss to<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_627" id="Page_627">627</a></span>
Judaism was greater? For instance, it gave currency
to grave errors, by making Judaism a theologic
system, and its representatives, the rabbis and
teachers of the law, mere clergymen and pastors.
This tendency narrowed Judaism, and degraded the
achievements bidding defiance to the centuries by
coupling them with contemporary phenomena. In
hot haste it desired to apply practically the results
of scientific investigation but recently made, or,
according to its shibboleth, to "establish harmony
between law and life"&mdash;sacrificing the half understood
law to life, <i>i. e.</i>, to the promptings of convenience,
to civil equality. Science was not in itself
an end, only the means whereby to deprive Judaism
of its characteristic peculiarities, and remodel it into
something entirely new. It desired to invest the
arbitrariness with which Friedl√§nder, Jacobson, and
their companions had introduced reforms with the
appearance of necessity, and justify it on scientific
grounds. By its violent, dogmatic attitude, fierce
opposition was aroused, and thus the seeds of dissension
were scattered in the vineyard of Jacob.</p>

<p>But even this phenomenon had its favorable side.
It was a challenge to the orthodox party, which had
hitherto met innovations with silence, or impotent
rage, but always awkwardly, or, as in the person of
Bernays, had made sphinx-like utterances. They
altogether denied the justification of the reform
which the advanced party so confidently urged. The
"Nineteen Letters on Judaism," by Ben Usiel, a
disciple of Bernays (1836), were the first tones of
a powerful opposition against the leveling of Judaism
to a commonplace religion, to consist of sermons,
German hymns, and confirmation, so forcing its
generous proportions to adapt themselves to the
narrow limits of the synagogue. This was the
commencement of a contest between two different
sets of views, a strife which has not yet ceased.
The struggle was confined to Germany. The Jews<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_628" id="Page_628">628</a></span>
of the other European countries were not cognizant
thereof. In Germany it was so difficult to destroy
the old state of ignominy, so toilsome to obtain the
new freedom, that educated Jews, imagining the
peculiarities of their belief to be one of the obstacles
in the way of securing equal privileges, were ready
to sacrifice these, trying to persuade themselves
that it was not surrender, merely a shedding of the
outer skin. Christian society refused to recognize
them as Germans, and, therefore, they desired to
show, by stripping off their original garb, that they
were Germans, naught but Germans, and kept up
only a distant connection with Judaism. The spirit
of subtle inquiry which had been awakened to a high
degree, chiefly in Germany, furthered the habit of
fault-finding, not alone with details, but with the
whole structure of Judaism; of considering it as a
work rotten with age, which, with the exception
of a few foundation-stones, ought to be destroyed.</p>

<p>It was strange that thoughtful Christians admired
the tents of Jacob in their simplicity, whilst the
adherents of Judaism felt confined in them, and
desired to exchange the Tabernacle and the Ark of
the Covenant for the pomp and parade of the
Church, or wished to surround them with disfiguring
adornments. Two poetically-gifted Christian
scholars, astounded by the wonderful fact that the
persecuted Jewish people even in modern days produced
neo-Hebraic poetry&mdash;spring blossoms in the
midst of the violence of winter&mdash;strove to spread
understanding and love of it in Christian circles.
The "History of Neo-Hebraic Poetry" (1836), by
Franz Delitzsch, and the "Hebrew Chrestomathy"
(1837), by Adam Martinet, are tokens of the homage
brought by Christians to the Jewish mind. The
authors were astounded at its creative faculty, and
at the capacity for development existing in the
Hebrew language, although they knew only fragments,
and were unacquainted with the most modern<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_629" id="Page_629">629</a></span>
and the fairest specimens of neo-Hebraic
poetry. This side of Jewish ability convinced them
of the immortality of the race. "No one can deny,"
remarked the former, "that the Jewish people is the
most remarkable of all nations, and next to those
of the Church, its history and literature deserve the
deepest and most devoted attention. Poetry forms
a large part of this colossal mass of literature, and
is the truest image of the inner history of this people.
The elegiac poetry of the synagogue reveals
to us the constant recurrence of suffering which
God imposed on the exiles, and the impressions
which these sufferings have left upon the heart of
the nation. The Orient is an exile in the midst of
the West, and from the tears of its home-sickness
springs forth Jewish poetry."</p>

<p>Martinet desired "to ascertain the height, depth,
and breadth of the Jewish spirit of our times as
shown in the treasures of its own literature," and
was fortunate in having found a noble, deeply interesting,
in every way fine fragment. His "Chrestomathy"
was intended as a vindication of neo-Hebraic
literature&mdash;beauteous Eastern flowers
reared upon Western soil, which he arranged in an
odorous bouquet, in order to gain admirers for them,
and induce them to cull radiant garlands of still
fairer flowers from the magic garden.</p>

<p>The new school of reform felt little of the enthusiasm
of appreciative Christians. They regretted
that doubts, conflict, and dissension had sprung up
in the place of confidence, peace, and perfect unity
and sincerity; that all minds were filled with uncertainty
and discomfort, creating a state of irritability
which enervated all will-power. But they themselves
had contributed, if not actually to call this
ill-humor into existence, at least to nurse it, and so
infect healthy minds. They imagined that the
decomposition of Judaism had already commenced
until they became convinced of it, and like romantic<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_630" id="Page_630">630</a></span>
dreamers indulged in artificial grief, until it became
real. In Germany, on account of the contest for
the removal of disabilities, the awakening of self-consciousness
and the dawn of knowledge were
purchased at a heavy price, at the cost of internal
disruption and self-torment.</p>

<p>The somber views of those who, whilst admiring
Judaism in its ancient and venerable form, yet
entertained doubts as to its continuance, were truthfully
represented in "The Plaints of a Jew" (1837).
The Prussian Jews at this time were placed in a
situation both comic and tragical by an ordinance
worthy of the Byzantine court promulgated by King
Frederick William III. Instead of a partial grant
of the liberty guaranteed to them, they were no
longer to be officially called "members of the
Mosaic faith," but curtly "Jews," and were not
allowed to bear Christian names. The police were
directed to insist that this law be carried into effect.
This method was expected to bring waverers over
to baptism. The self-respect of the Jews was not
yet sufficiently strengthened for them to endure the
intended humiliation with dignity. Many Jews in
the large cities, especially in Berlin, who were
nearer to the church than to the synagogue, considered
it a slight, and implored the king to protect
them against such undeserved contempt. They
mourned as if they were to be again thrust into
exile. This comic sadness was depicted after the
manner of the Psalms in "The Plaints of a Jew."</p>

<blockquote>

<p>"The children of my people came to me complaining and weeping.
The old men and the mothers drew near, and anxious suffering was
depicted on their countenances. I asked the little ones, 'Why are
you weeping so early in life?' and to the elders I said, 'Why are you
complaining so late in life?' The children lisped, 'Alas! we may no
longer bear the bright, beautiful names of the Christians, but have to
use the dull, hateful ones of the Jews. We are meant to be branded
at our very games.' And the old men said, 'The quiver of anger is
again emptied, and threatens our children with misery and danger.'
Then I replied, ... 'Comfort yourselves, be quiet, and bear
proudly the proud names of your fathers. They are the names of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_631" id="Page_631">631</a></span>
heroes, of martyrs crowned with fame, of an ancient nobility, of an
ancient knighthood.... When the West was still sunk in utter
barbarism, your names flourished in immortal splendor, ruling the
world, and enlightening and delivering it. For I say unto you, that
before the hand of the clock of history turns round, many empty
names of the West will be swept off the face of the earth like stubble
by the sharp scythe. But as long as time endures there will always
remain royally enthroned the names of Abraham, Moses, and
Isaiah.'"</p></blockquote>

<p>Joel Jacoby, the son of a strictly orthodox father,
introduced into his "Plaints of a Jew" many untrue
outpourings of fantastic sentimentality and a feigned
sense of pain; but some of his elegies are ardent
and beautifully constructed.</p>

<p>If Joel Jacoby wavering between faith and apostasy
thus addressed Judaism, "Feeble is thy body, my
people, and thy spirit weary: therefore do I bring
thee a coffin and dedicate to thee a tomb"; and if
Geiger's paper, half in pain, half in spite, testified
that "the bond which used to keep together the
congregations is torn asunder, and now they are
only externally united, the will-power of the community
is broken," the wish was father to the
thought, or the writers greatly deceived themselves.
Superficial observers, self-willed opinionists,
they thought the symptoms of rapid growth
signs of swift consumption, and praised their own
quack medicines, which would surely have brought
about dissolution.</p>

<p>An unforeseen event, insignificant at the beginning,
but of vast importance in its results, gave the
lie to the false prophets and quacks, and showed
how wondrous the force which holds the members
of the Jewish race in an indissoluble union; how
strong the invisible bond which without their knowledge
embraces them; and how a serious menace
to Judaism arouses the patriotism of the reformer<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_633" id="Page_633">633</a></span>
and the orthodox, of the politician who appears to
have forsaken his faith and the recluse engrossed
only in the Kabbala or the Talmud, of the Jew in
frivolous France and of him in serious Asia.
Strangely enough, the despised "Jewish Question"
became interwoven in the complicated threads of
European and Asiatic politics, and the Russian
despot Nicholas as also the American Republic had
to take up the cause of the Jews in Damascus. He
who remembers this time, and can appreciate the
marvels of history, cannot misunderstand the wonderful
intermingling of events. Ratti Menton, an
Italian naturalized in France, a reckless, unconscientious
fortune-hunter; Hanna Bachari Bey, a
renegade, who had passed from Christianity to
Islam, a thorough knave and bitter Jew-hater;
Mohammed El-Telli, a man of like caliber, who
threatened a rich Jew in Damascus with a blood
accusation unless he advanced money to relieve him
of his difficulties; and finally a Christian Arab,
Shibli Ajub, a worthless wretch panting for revenge,
because he had been imprisoned on the charge of
embezzlement preferred by a Jew; this is the list
of fiends who originated a bloody drama, in which
the part of martyrs was once more played by the
Jews. But their sufferings induced courage, exaltation,
and proud self-reliance.</p>

<p>Political events, as intimated, served as the background
for this drama. The cunning Mehmet Ali,
Pasha of Egypt, by splendid victories had wrested
all Syria and Palestine from the Turkish sultan, his
feudal lord. He oppressed the inhabitants of these
countries more severely even than those of his own
pashalic, in order to fill his coffers. The so-called
Citizen King, Louis Philippe, equally cunning, in
order to disarm the resentment of the legitimate
princes of Europe, supported Mehmet Ali's plans
of conquest, and French agents aided the Egyptian
robbery system. These intrigues increased when the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_634" id="Page_634">634</a></span>
strong-minded but unfortunate Sultan Mohammed
was dead, and his weak, pampered son, Abdul
Meg'id, only seventeen years old, ascended the
throne (July, 1839). Then the Eastern Question
commenced to wax warm. Russia supported feeble
Turkey that it might not fall into the arms of
Mehmet Ali. France, on the other hand, supported
the Egyptian robber, in order to checkmate
Russia. Austria and England were unsettled in
their policy, and Prussia was the fifth wheel on the
van of the European Pentarchy. Owing to the
close union between Louis Philippe and Mehmet
Ali, the Christians in Palestine and Syria, hitherto
oppressed, could now raise their heads; for France
delighted to pose as the protector of Christianity in
the East in order to gain title and power, as she
coquetted with the clerical party at home in order
to suppress the friends of liberty. The clergy and
monks of many orders in the East, especially the
Catholics or Latins, until lately the oppressed, now,
relying upon French protection, became the
oppressors.</p>

<p>In Damascus, which at that time contained five
thousand Jewish families, or about twenty thousand
souls, the guardian of a Capuchin cloister, Father
Tomaso (Thomas), of Sardinia, together with his
servant, disappeared one day (February 5, 1840).
He was no saint in the Catholic sense of the word,
but a man of the world, more ready to take than to
give money. He pottered in medicine, especially
occupying himself with inoculation for small-pox,
and as often visited in Jewish and Mahometan as in
Christian quarters. What had become of the
Father so well known to the whole population of
Damascus? No one knew exactly. There was a
rumor that Tomaso had some days before quarreled
with a Turkish mule-driver, who was said to have
sworn, "This Christian dog shall die by no other
hand than mine." It was said that insults and violence<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_635" id="Page_635">635</a></span>
followed. As soon as it was known that the
Father had disappeared, and had probably met with
a violent death, the monks besieged the unscrupulous
Ratti Menton, the French consul in Damascus,
with entreaties to search for the murderer. Attention
was immediately directed to the Jews, some of
them having innocently testified that they had seen
Tomaso and his servant in the Jewish quarter, on
the evening before they disappeared. The monks,
chief among them a fanatical Jew-hater, Father
Tusti, quickly caught up the suspicion against the
Jews, hoping thereby to gain several ends. They
could satiate their hatred against the Jews, suppress
the inquiry as to whether Father Tomaso had
indeed quarreled with Mussulmans and reviled
them, and finally a new martyr, slain by the Jews,
would be added to their list of saints, which was
always a source of profit. Ratti Menton, in turn,
from interested motives, quickly endorsed the suspicion
against the Jews, and relinquished every
other theory, although a clue had been given by the
fact that the Turkish merchant, who had been present
at the quarrel with the Father, had hanged himself.
Sherif Pasha, the governor of Damascus, was
readily induced to permit or carry on the persecution
of the Jews from a desire to be on friendly
terms with the French consul, and hoping to obtain
profit for himself from a blood accusation against
the Jews. To save appearances, the accusers
quoted the evidence of a pious fraud, who assured
them that Tomaso and his servant had been murdered
in the Jewish quarter in such and such a
house. This trick was probably perpetrated by
Bachari Bey. The Turkish rascal, Mohammed
El-Telli, offered his services as a spy to Ratti Menton,
if he would free him from prison and debt. He
willingly consented; the two scoundrels were
worthy of each other.</p>

<p>Proofs soon accumulated. Christians testified<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_636" id="Page_636">636</a></span>
that they had heard Jews say, "Let us shut the
gates, and not go out, because danger is imminent,"
or that they had seen the monk in the house of a
Jew shortly before his disappearance. The bill of
accusation was quickly prepared: "The Jews have
murdered Tomaso and his servant to use the blood
for their Passover Festival,"&mdash;as though they would
be so ridiculous as to keep it for six weeks! Efforts
were made to arouse the Christians and the Turkish
populace. Several Jews were arrested, brought
before Ratti Menton, and examined. A poor Jewish
barber from inborn fear showed great confusion
during the examination in the presence of the spies.
But he firmly denied participation in, or knowledge
of, the murder of the missing monk. Nevertheless
the French consul handed him over for trial to
Sherif Pasha, as a man under strong suspicion. The
latter ordered him to receive the bastinado, five
hundred blows with a stick upon the soles of his
feet. This torture, however, appeared too mild to
Ratti Menton. The poor barber was subjected to
the cruellest tortures, but he remained steadfast.
He was then visited by Mohammed El-Telli, who
was in prison for debt. Induced by deceitful
speeches, the barber, afraid of fresh torture, agreed
to name the guilty persons. He named, upon suggestion,
seven distinguished and wealthy Jews,
David Arari (Harari), with his son and brothers,
then Moses Abulafia, Moses Saloniki, and Joseph
Laniado, an old man of eighty years. When arrested
and examined they denied their guilt. The
bastinado was resorted to, but the executioners,
fearing that the old men would sink under the
blows, and that their confessions would be of no
use, employed another method of torture. The
accused, guarded by soldiers, were compelled to
stand erect for thirty-six hours, without food or
drink, and without being allowed to go to sleep.
As this torture bore no result, the bloodthirsty villains<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_637" id="Page_637">637</a></span>
proceeded at Ratti Menton's orders to inflict
a violent beating with switches; at the twentieth
blow the unhappy victims fell to the ground unconscious.
The French consul nevertheless ordered
the scourging to be continued when they revived.</p>

<p>All this, however, did not extort a confession.
Sherif Pasha invented a new species of torment, or
employed one suggested to him. More than sixty
children between the ages of three and ten were
torn from their parents, shut up in a room, and deprived
of food, so that the mothers, agonized by the
piteous cries of the children, might be driven to
make confessions, even though untrue ones. This
means also failed. In spite of compassion for their
children, the Jewish mothers in no way confirmed
the horrible accusation. Only one woman and her
daughter were driven by grief and love of their
children into the arms of Islam. Sherif Pasha became
enraged, and threatened that if the Father
were not found, many Jewish heads should fall.
With a band of soldiers (February 18) he marched
into the Jewish quarter, and commanded the magnificent
house of David Arari to be destroyed, in
order to find the corpse of the monk or suspicious
traces. The houses of the other accused were also
ruined. Distressed by so much cruelty, a Jewish
youth ventured to go to the Pasha and give evidence
that he had seen Father Tomaso enter the
shop of a Turk shortly before his disappearance.
Instead of following this clue, Ratti Menton and his
private secretary, Baudin, tried to hush up the evidence.
The youth was unmercifully flogged, and in
the same night died, the first martyr in this tragedy.</p>

<p>Ratti Menton was inexhaustible in devices for extorting
a confession from the Jews. He ordered
an experiment to be tried upon David Arari's
Turkish servant, Murad el Fallat. He had nothing
to confess, and permitted himself to be scourged
till his body was almost lacerated. Mohammed El-<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_638" id="Page_638">638</a></span>Telli
then interviewed him, and by mingling friendly
overtures and threats obtained some information
from him. The servant accused himself of having
murdered Tomaso at the command of David Arari
in the presence of the other prisoners; and the Jewish
barber was persuaded to confirm this statement.
Ratti Menton then caused the two mutilated men to
be led to a place where the bones and skulls were
supposed to have been thrown into a canal. He
found a piece of bone and a fragment of cloth;
Christian doctors declared that this bone belonged
to a human body, and the patch was judged to be
part of the monk's cowl. Positive proof of the
murder having been thus found in the Jewish quarter,
the seven accused were again examined, and
subjected to cruel tortures. They were ordered to
produce the flask of blood taken from the murdered
men for the Passover Festival. The tortures killed
the old man Joseph Laniado. Moses Abulafia, to
escape further torture, assumed the turban. The
others, worn out by suffering, said all that was
demanded of them; they had become dull, and only
desired a speedy death. Their confession, however,
did not help them. The French consul
wanted tangible evidence, such as the flask of blood
and other proofs. But the poor prisoners, however
willing, were unable to produce them.</p>

<p>New tortures were applied, the only result being
that the wretched victims retracted their former
confessions. As Ratti Menton needed new victims,
Arari's servant was required to assist in supplying
them early in March. Suspicion fell upon
other distinguished Jewish families: upon the
wealthy family of Farchi (Parchi), upon a young
man named Isaac Levi Picciotto (Peixotto), and
upon Aaron Stambuli. Three rabbis of Damascus,
Jacob Anteri, Solomon and Azaria Halfen, had
been arrested earlier, and tortured, but the desired
evidence was not obtained. Of the distinguished<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_639" id="Page_639">639</a></span>
Jews said to be implicated in the charge of murder,
only two could be found: Raphael Murad Farchi
who, owing to his high position as consul, thought
himself safe, and Picciotto, the nephew of the consul-general
of Aleppo, who had been knighted for
his services by the Austrian emperor. Picciotto
alone remained steadfast, and boldly upbraided
Ratti Menton and the Pasha with the inhumanity of
their conduct. He was protected by the Austrian
consul, an Italian named Merlato, who despite all
threats and arguments refused to allow an Austrian
subject to be tortured without substantial proofs of
his guilt. This new complication produced a
change in the horrifying drama. Merlato had long
looked on calmly at the inhuman acts, like the other
European consuls, especially the English consul
named Werry, who was Ratti Menton's accomplice.
But at length Merlato's patience was exhausted; he
openly attacked the barbarous, horrible proceedings.
Consequently he had to endure a good deal
of abuse. The Christian populace heaped curses
upon him, because he defended the Jews, and
would not surrender his prot√©g√© Picciotto into the
hands of the cannibals. His house was surrounded
by spies, and the Mahometan mob was also inflamed
against the Jews by foul means.</p>

<p>Ratti Menton was indefatigable in inventing new
charges and sham proofs. He ordered a contemptible
book against the Jews, by Lucio Ferrajo, which
had been shown him by the monks, to be translated
into Arabic. This book proved from the Talmud
that the Jews used blood, that they slew Christian
children, and outraged the Host, which afterwards
worked miracles. The Arabic translation was given
by Ratti Menton to Sherif Pasha, and he circulated
it among the Mahometan populace. To set on foot
a thorough-going persecution, Franciscus of Sardinia,
a venomous Capuchin monk, was brought
from Beyrout, being well known for his ability to<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_640" id="Page_640">640</a></span>
give an appearance of truth to perversions and
falsehoods. The Pasha then commanded that the
three imprisoned rabbis be separated, and directed
to translate into Arabic certain suspicious passages
in the Talmud, with the threat of death if they were
caught in a deception. Thoughtful Turks shook
their heads at this systematic persecution of the
Jews; but they held their peace. Ratti Menton
closed the proceedings, and pronounced judgment,
as if it had been incontrovertibly proved, that the
arrested and tortured Jews were the murderers of
Father Tomaso. Those still alive were sentenced
to be beheaded. Sherif Pasha obtained the assent
of his lord, Mehmet Ali, to this deed.</p>

<p>As if to give verisimilitude to the blood-accusation
against the Jews, and justify their destruction
as bloodthirsty cannibals, a similar incident occurred
at about the same time on the island of Rhodes,
which belonged to Turkey. A boy of ten years of
age, the son of a Greek peasant, had hanged himself,
and the Christians hastened to charge the Jews
with his murder. The European consuls took the
matter in hand, and demanded of the governor,
Jussuf Pasha, a strict investigation against the Jews.
Upon the evidence of two Greek women that the
boy had followed a Jew of Rhodes, the man was
arrested, tried, imprisoned, and, because of his
denial, inhumanly tortured. His nostrils were
pierced by an iron wire, red-hot coals placed upon
his head, and a heavy stone upon his breast. This
was done or approved by Europeans and Christians,
consuls of the European powers, of England,
France, and Sweden. Here, too, the Austrian consul
took no part in the barbarous persecution. The
torture was applied to the accused Jew by his officers
without the knowledge of the Pasha. The
confession which they desired to obtain was that he
had killed the Greek boy to send his blood to the
chief rabbi at Constantinople. It was a sort of conspiracy<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_641" id="Page_641">641</a></span>
of the Christians in Turkey against the Jews,
to bring them to the edge of the precipice, perhaps
due to envy, because the young Sultan, Abdul
Meg'id, on ascending the throne, in his congratulatory
address (Hatti-Sherif of Gulhane) had conceded
equal privileges to all subjects of his kingdom, Jews
included. The Greeks and Latins in Turkey
thought but little of their freedom, because they
had to share it with the hated Jews.</p>

<p>Induced by the cruel torture, the half lifeless Jew
in Rhodes made a confession. He incriminated
several Jews in the murder of the boy, hoping that
they had already fled from fear of persecution. But
some of them were still in Rhodes. As in Damascus,
they were incarcerated, tortured, and brought
near to death's door. Nevertheless they remained
firm. The consuls then ordered the Ghetto to be
closed, so that no one might pass in and out, and
the Jews might be unable to lay their complaints
before the Pasha, or even before the Sultan. For
three days the Jews received no food from outside.
Greeks were constantly prowling around the Ghetto
to throw in bones, to be able to say afterwards that
they were the bones of a murdered Christian. The
Austrian consul, who at first had taken the part of
the Jews, was ultimately induced to join their enemies.</p>

<p>In consequence of this double accusation, a perfect
storm arose against the Jews in Syria and
Turkey. In Djabar, near Damascus, the mob broke
into the synagogue, pillaged and destroyed it, and
tore the scrolls of the Law to shreds. In Beyrout
the Jews were protected from ill-treatment by the
interposition of Laurilla, the Dutch consul, and
Sason, the Prussian consul. The spirit of enmity
spread as far as Smyrna, and was attended by
many attacks upon the Jews.</p>

<p>Was it a mere accident that at the same time
(beginning of March, 1840) a blood accusation was<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_642" id="Page_642">642</a></span>
raised against a Jew in Rhenish Prussia, in J√ºlich?
A Christian girl, nine years of age, asserted that a
Jew had stabbed her. Her little brother, six years
old, confirmed her statement. A Jew and his wife,
who happened to be journeying through J√ºlich, were
identified by the children as the criminals, and the
girl added that the Jew at the same time had killed
an old Christian with a knife. If truth speaks from
the mouth of children, this Jew would have had to
be sentenced as a murderer of Christians, a vampire.
If the torture had been applied, an avowal of the
crime would probably have been extorted from the
Jew and his wife. But a strict judicial inquiry
elicited that the statements of the children were idle
falsehoods and deception. The Christian supposed
to have been murdered was alive. The pretended
wound on the girl's body was only a smudge of
blood. The accused Jew was acquitted, and a
rumor, referred to by the state attorney himself,
charged two Christians from D√ºsseldorf with having
drummed these horrible accusations into the
children's heads.</p>

<p>In Rhenish Prussia the truth and the innocence
of the Jews were brought to light quickly. In
Damascus and Rhodes, on the other hand, the
struggle was prolonged, because fiendish European
Christians had intentionally woven such a network
of lies, that even guileless persons were deceived.
In vain the ill-treated Jews wrung their hands, and
entreated their European brethren to aid them by
means of their more favorable circumstances. They
found it exceedingly difficult to bring the truth to
light and to unmask villainy. Religious fanaticism,
Jud√¶ophobia, and political party passions, all combined
to assist the triumph of falsehood. The
underhand plotters employed the art of Guttenberg&mdash;whose
four hundredth jubilee was then being
celebrated&mdash;to circulate accusations throughout the
world that Jews were eager drinkers of Christian
blood.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_643" id="Page_643">643</a></span>
Ratti Menton arranged that a report from Damascus
presenting the events from his point of view
be inserted in the French journals to inform the
European world that the Jews had murdered a
priest and his servant, and had collected the blood
for their unleavened bread for the Passover. One
corpse had been thrown into the canal in their
quarter, and the other into a Jew's cellar. They
had confessed, acknowledging that they had committed
the crime in order to celebrate the mysteries
of their religion. Without Ratti Menton's
zeal the culprits would not have been discovered, and
without his interposition the Jewish quarter and all
its inhabitants would have been destroyed. Not
only the newspapers controlled by the Catholic
clergy zealously spread this charge against the
Jews, but also the liberal journals, in order to glorify
the power of France in the East, published as facts
all the distorted statements from Damascus. The
eyes of Europe being at this time directed towards
the entanglements in Turkey, the false reports rapidly
spread through the veins of European journalism.
The hatred of the Middle Ages against the
Jews might have been easily re-awakened, and
might have caused scenes of blood to be re-enacted.
The Jews of Europe were filled with horror that in
the broad daylight of the nineteenth century they
had still to contend against the dark specter of the
blood accusation, that it might not drag them down
into the grave.</p>

<p>The press, which had been used by their adversaries,
was now employed to greater advantage in
the cause of the Jews. Calumnies and lying accusations
against them could no longer be concealed
under the veil of secrecy. There were courageous
Jews who tore off the mask of virtue from falsehood
and hypocrisy. Such a man was Adolf Cr√©mieux
(born 1796, died 1880), who shortly before this time
had celebrated triumphs of eloquence. This extraordinary<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_644" id="Page_644">644</a></span>
man was destined, as will be shown, to
become the bold and powerful advocate of the Jews
in their tribulation. The false charges brought
against them in Damascus made him their advocate,
and induced him to take an active part in the history
of his co-religionists. Cr√©mieux, who, among
the many talented orators of France, was considered
an exceptionally fine speaker, employed his
great gifts in the defense of innocent prisoners,
without distinction of creed, position, or party.
Although Cr√©mieux was at this time a member of
the Franco-Jewish consistory, he had not hitherto
troubled himself much about Jewish affairs; his soul
was filled with patriotism for France. The blood
accusation at Damascus, which had been spread far
and wide by the opponents of the Jews, first reminded
him of his Jewish origin, and inspired him with
courage and zeal to take up the cause of his brethren
in religion and race, and developed in him a
glowing patriotism for Judaism. At the first news
of the dark proceedings in Damascus, thoroughly
convinced that the Eastern like the European Jews
were innocent of blood, Cr√©mieux hastened to the
French minister to ask him whether the government
had more precise information on the matter.
The minister replied that he had not received the
slightest information on the subject from the consul
or any other source. Thus it was made evident
how this game was played. With all the glowing
fire of his eloquence and the courage instilled by a
righteous cause, Cr√©mieux opposed the wide-spread
slanders which echoed through France (April 7),
and became the center of a patriotic movement of
the French communities. Cr√©mieux was then vice-president
of the central consistory; and the Jews
of France looked to him, their appointed representative,
to rend asunder the network of lies which
extended from Damascus to France.</p>

<p>Like the French Jews, those of England also<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_645" id="Page_645">645</a></span>
aroused themselves suddenly. By their wealth and
honorable conduct they stood very high in public
opinion. Some had been elected to fill the honorable
post of sheriff; and it was to be expected that
they would soon be admitted into Parliament. The
most distinguished Jews of England, among them
Baron Nathaniel Rothschild, Sir Moses Montefiore
(who from a pious sentiment had undertaken a pilgrimage
to the Holy Land), Salomons, and the
highly-esteemed brothers Goldsmid, held a meeting
(April 21), and resolved to appeal to the governments
of England, France, and Austria, to use their
influence to put a stop to the inhuman proceedings
in Damascus. Cr√©mieux came to London, and was
present at the meeting, in order to consider a common
course of action. The unanimity was noteworthy
with which prominent Jews took up the
cause of their persecuted brethren, and defended
the purity of Judaism, of its Law, and the Talmud.
On the same day (May 1), Cr√©mieux presented himself
before Louis Philippe, king of France, and a
Jewish deputation waited on the English minister,
Lord Palmerston, in order to obtain the protection
of these two countries for the victims in Damascus.</p>

<p>Louis Philippe replied with much feeling:</p>

<blockquote>

<p>"I do not know anything about the occurrence; but if anywhere
there are unfortunate Jews who appeal to the protection of my government,
and if anything can be effected by its means, I will conform
with your wishes."</p></blockquote>

<p>Whether the asseveration was seriously meant
by this diplomatic monarch cannot be known. A
vice-consul was, however, appointed to visit Damascus,
investigate the matter, and draw up a report.
But he was only a subordinate, whom, as might
have been imagined, Ratti Menton could easily
deceive, or venture to oppose. The answer of
Lord Palmerston was more straightforward. He
promised the Jewish deputation, who laid before
him full proofs of the innocence of the accused at<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_646" id="Page_646">646</a></span>
Damascus and Rhodes, that he would empower the
English ambassador at Constantinople, as also the
consul at Alexandria, to use every effort to check
the continuance of such cruelties. In another quarter,
less public, but more effective, steps were taken
to obtain the support of Vienna and the Austrian
cabinet. The Austrian consul in Damascus, Merlato,
was the only one who had seen through the
wickedness of Ratti Menton, his assistants, and the
monks, and with true soldierly courage had offered
firm resistance. In return, he was abused by his
opponents both in the East and the West; they
decried him as a Jew, to throw suspicion upon his
defense of the Jews, and thus destroy its effects.
But Merlato felt himself morally pledged to plead
the innocence of the Jews as a personal matter. He
issued a faithful and comprehensive report of the
groundless attacks of the mob upon the victims at
Damascus. This narrative, a defense of his conduct
in protecting Picciotto, he despatched to his
superior, the consul-general of Egypt, and it was
sent by the latter as a correct account to Metternich,
the Austrian minister. Although adverse to
publicity, Metternich had allowed all writings favorable
to the Jews to be circulated in the newspapers.
In this report Ratti Menton, whom the clerical intriguers
had glorified as an angel of light, was shown
to be an evil demon. A revolution ensued in public
opinion which filled the Jews with courage, and
foreshadowed the triumph of justice. It is difficult
to say whether Metternich's intervention in this
matter arose from his own impulse, from displeasure
at the cruelty practiced, or from political hostility
to France and a desire to break her power in
the East, or, perhaps, from complaisance to the
house of Rothschild, whose members were extraordinarily
zealous on behalf of their co-religionists
in this affair. At any rate, Metternich encouraged
the Austrian agents in Egypt and Syria to stand
up boldly in defense of the Jews.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_647" id="Page_647">647</a></span>
In Constantinople, at the divan of the Sultan, the
representatives of European governments friendly
to the Jews, obtained a revision of the trial for
blood accusation in the island of Rhodes. Jewish
deputies from Rhodes had at length succeeded in
reaching Constantinople. Nathaniel de Rothschild
also betook himself thither, and as a result Abdul
Meg'id issued a Firman (July 27) that the Greek
population should send to the capital three primates
as accusers, and the Jews as many elders as defendants.
A tribunal, under the presidency of Risaat
Bey, was appointed to inquire into the matter, the
result being that Jussuf Pasha was dismissed from
his post of governor of Rhodes, and the Jews
charged with child-murder were acquitted. Further,
they were instructed to demand compensation for
the losses sustained from those who had unjustly
accused them, viz., some of the European consuls.
In three months&mdash;from the beginning of May till
towards the end of July&mdash;the affair was settled.</p>

<p>With Mehmet Ali there were greater difficulties
to be encountered. He had, indeed, as early as the
beginning of April, promised the Austrian consul-general
Laurin to put an end to the atrocities; but
this was prevented by the French consul-general,
Cochelet, and, foolishly trusting in France, he could
not quarrel with the agents of the French government.
But Laurin, acting on the instructions of
Metternich, was untiring in his efforts to withdraw
the Pasha of Egypt from the net of the French
intriguers. At his instigation the Jews of Alexandria
presented an eloquent and spirited address to
Mehmet Ali. It was remarkable that the Egyptian
Jews did not receive the bastinado for speaking the
truth; Mehmet Ali well knew who supported them.
A letter of Metternich to the Pasha produced a
wonderfully favorable effect. In the settlement of
the Eastern Question, the latter could not afford to
break with Austria, from which country the Sultan<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_648" id="Page_648">648</a></span>
could obtain reinforcements more quickly than from
France.</p>

<p>Mehmet Ali therefore resolved to form a court
of justice, consisting of the consuls of Austria,
England, Russia, and Prussia, to carry on the trial
according to European usages. The tribunal was
empowered to dispatch a commission to Damascus,
and institute an impartial examination of witnesses
on the spot. An order was sent to Damascus to
Sherif Pasha, commanding him to discontinue the
torture of the prisoners, and in general to stop the
persecution of the Jews. To suppress any riotous
outbreak of the Christians, whose courage had
increased, eight hundred soldiers were sent thither.
The matter began to look as if the truth would be
vindicated. The four consuls nominated as chief
judges, diffident of their ability to conduct so complicated
a trial, turned for aid to Vienna, and asked
that four German judges, well versed in criminal
law, investigate the matter, but a political interlude
interrupted the proceedings.</p>

<p>A secret war was waged between the overwise
king, Louis Philippe, and the cunning statesman
Thiers, who was trifling with the minister's portfolio,
and whose little person and big phrases so
thwarted the king that he kept him as much as possible
at arm's length. Just at this time (in May)
Thiers played a trick on the king, and forced him
to make him president of the cabinet. The little
"fly," as he was called, began to hum and buzz,
behaving as if he could acquire the Rhine as French
property, and settle the Eastern Question according
to the views of France. To secure a majority
in the Chamber, Thiers was forced to gain the good
graces of the clerical party, which was especially
strong in the Chamber of Peers. Thus it happened
that no strict investigation into the Damascus affair
could be permitted, in order that the brutal behavior
of Ratti Menton and the monks might not be<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_649" id="Page_649">649</a></span>
brought to light. At any rate, it had been a slight
upon France that its consul had been excluded from
the new court of justice. Besides this, Thiers was
not on friendly terms with the financial world, that
is, with the Rothschilds, and he desired to strike a
blow to make them yield. The French consul-general
Cochelet, in Alexandria, received instructions
from Thiers to stay the hand of Mehmet Ali,
and prevent the misdeeds in Damascus from being
brought to light. The Egyptian Pasha, misled by
Thiers' plotting, obeyed his orders, and withdrew
the promise made to the four consuls. Thus the
drama which had seemed to be approaching a conclusion
was again prolonged, but its end was not
favorable to Thiers and his prot√©g√©s.</p>

<p>Jews of every shade of opinion had become possessed
of sufficient independence to defy the prevarications
of a minister or of a consul. Achille
Fould, who was bound to Judaism by only a slender
tie, as well as the strictly orthodox Hirsch Lehren
in Amsterdam, both regarded it as their duty to
take a bold part in the defense of their persecuted
co-religionists in Syria. In the French Chamber of
Deputies (July 2) Fould questioned Thiers so
sharply that the latter was forced to make excuses.</p>

<blockquote>

<p>"The French consul had ordered the torture, and after the French
nation had set the example of obedience to the rule of 'equality before
the law' as well as in religious matters, a Frenchman countenanced
this exception to the rule, employed torture, and thus supported the
executioners of the Pasha. This behavior was so deeply resented by
the other European agents that the French ambassador was excluded
from the council which had been established, because he was the
accuser, whilst the others were the defending advocates."</p></blockquote>

<p>To this statement Thiers was compelled to reply,
but each word he uttered sounded like a falsehood.
Two Christian deputies took the part of the Jews in
this discussion. Count Delaborde, who had traveled
in the East, highly praised the Jews of Turkey,
and stated that well-deserved respect was accorded
to them, and that, like Lamartine, he had received<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_650" id="Page_650">650</a></span>
the most hearty and generous hospitality from
their wealthy members. Thiers' positive assertion
that he was in possession of papers which proved
the innocence of Ratti Menton, was met by another
deputy, Isambert; he produced a report drawn
up by the apostolical missionary, the successor
of Father Tomaso, which stated "that the exertions
and zeal of the French consul in torturing the
Jews of Damascus surpassed all comprehension."
The Chamber of Deputies, however, did not pass a
vote of censure upon the minister, who so belied the
courteous character of the French nation, but the
looks of the deputies condemned him. Thiers felt
such discomfort that he made a petty attack upon
the Jews, "who had stirred up a storm throughout
Europe, asking the assistance of the ministers of
every state, and had thus shown that they possessed
more influence than was asserted."</p>

<p>The Jews, to be sure, had to unite and develop
especial activity, seeing that the Catholic party in
France, Italy, and Belgium had formally conspired,
or received a hint from headquarters to enshroud in
darkness the events in Damascus, and to represent
the Jews in the East and in Europe as murderers
and cannibals. Throughout Italy the documents in
favor of the Damascus victims or against Ratti
Menton were not allowed to be printed: the censorship,
which was under the care of the clergy, forbade
it. A French journal had called on baptized
Jews to state upon oath and to the best of their
knowledge, whether they had ever found among
their former co-religionists or in Jewish writings, the
slightest trace or precept concerning the abominable
crime imputed to the unhappy people in Damascus.
Several Jews who had been converted to
Protestantism, and even held ecclesiastical positions,
asserted the innocence of the Jews of this crime&mdash;amongst
them, Augustus Neander, known as
Church historian and a man of tender conscience.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_651" id="Page_651">651</a></span>
No Catholics, with the exception of one man, came
forward to do so. Perhaps they were compelled to
remain silent. The clerical enemies of the Jews
now published a fresh accusation, that the Talmud
which the European Jews knew and studied might
indeed be free from passages hostile to Christians
and advising the shedding of blood, which may have
been expunged from the copies out of fear, but the
Jews of the Orient, under Turkish rule, still possessed
the Talmud in its original form, which was
full of hatred against all men, especially against
Christians.</p>

<p>Thus the Jews were forced to establish a bond of
truth against the untrue, to make public the innocence
of the martyrs in Damascus, and at the same
time attest the purity of their own doctrines; in
short, they had to help themselves. The French
central consistory, which had received solemn promises
from Louis Philippe, saw itself deceived in its
hopes. Cr√©mieux was compelled to make the painful
statement to his brethren, "France is against
us." The urgent cries of the Jews from Damascus,
Beyrout, Alexandria, and Constantinople, in letters
to the Rothschilds, to Moses Montefiore, Cr√©mieux,
and to Hirsch Lehren in Amsterdam, made it apparent
that it was necessary for prominent European
Jews to repair to the scene of action, in order to
obtain more effective results. The central consistory
therefore determined to send an emissary, with
an escort, to Alexandria, whose burning eloquence
might gain the favor of Mehmet Ali. Entrusted
with this dangerous and honorable mission, Cr√©mieux
entered into communication with the heads of
the Jewish community in London.</p>

<p>Here a committee of the noblest and most distinguished
Jews, including Montefiore and Rothschild,
had been formed, who, in a meeting held in
the vestibule of a synagogue (June 15), passed the
following important resolution, that Montefiore,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_652" id="Page_652">652</a></span>
accompanied by a friend chosen by himself, should
undertake the journey to Egypt together with
Cr√©mieux, "to represent the Jews of England at the
court of the Pasha, and to defend their persecuted
brethren in the East by means of his weighty influence
and his zeal." It was also determined at this
meeting to collect large sums of money, because it
was seen that they would be wanted, not indeed as
bribes in the pending trial at Damascus, but that
large rewards might be offered to discover the murderer
of Father Tomaso. A thousand pounds
sterling were offered as a reward for the discovery
of the criminal. The readiness of the Jews to contribute
was on this occasion again manifested in a
most conspicuous manner. Poor men as well as
millionaires contributed to the just cause. The
committee also caused unfalsified public opinion,
as it exists in England, to make itself heard in
Parliament on behalf of the Jews, and Sir Robert
Peel, who exercised great influence, undertook this
task.</p>

<p>The session of the House of Commons (June 22)
affords an interesting contrast to the sitting of the
French Chamber of Deputies at the same time and
upon the same subject. Peel rightly introduced the
questions to the ministers with the words, "that it
was merely necessary to mention the matter in the
Lower House, to reach the great ends of justice and
humanity." Lord Palmerston answered in a totally
different manner to Thiers:</p>

<blockquote>

<p>"I have already directed the English consul-general Hodges to
represent to Mehmet Ali what effect the news of such atrocities must
produce in Europe, and that it was in his own interest to inquire into
the matter, and hand over to punishment the guilty parties, if they
were discovered, whilst the innocent victims should be indemnified,
if this were still possible. I have also sent instructions to Her
Majesty's consul in Damascus to make a thorough investigation into
all that has taken place, and to send home an exact report as to the
part which the European consuls had taken in the matter."</p></blockquote>

<p>The air of England rendered susceptible to feelings
of liberty even those who were accustomed to<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_653" id="Page_653">653</a></span>
elevate the enslavement of bodies and minds to the
rank of a dogma. O'Connell, the fiery Irish agitator
for the emancipation of the Catholics in England,
advocated in Parliament that a similar privilege be
granted to the Jews.</p>

<blockquote>

<p>"Observations upon this subject would have been stronger, if a
member of this House belonging to the creed of the accused had been
able to make them. The Government ought to introduce a bill for
the complete emancipation of the Jews."</p></blockquote>

<p>Thus spake England by the mouths of its worthiest
representatives.</p>

<p>Next day (June 23) a numerous assembly of the
most distinguished Jews in London was held in the
Great Synagogue to make final arrangements for
sending Montefiore to Egypt. It was proved on
this occasion what a noble circle of Jews England
harbored, and that their minds were filled by lofty
sentiments of attachment to Judaism and its adherents.
Hitherto the English Jews had taken but
little part in Jewish history, they had remained passive
owing to their insignificant numbers. But when
for the first time they asserted themselves, they
displayed their independence, and gave a brilliant
example to others. Montefiore, De Castro, Rothschild,
Van Oven, Salomons, and many others, spoke
and acted like Jews conscious of their dignity, who
were ready to make the greatest sacrifices, in order
to secure the triumph of their impugned belief.
Cr√©mieux had come over from Paris to be present.
The meeting first acknowledged its gratitude to
those men, Christians as well as Jews, who had
zealously defended the unhappy people of Damascus,
viz., James de Rothschild, who had largely contributed
towards the support of the impoverished
Jews in Damascus, Metternich and his agents,
Laurin and Merlato, and also Hodges, the English
consul. Bernard van Oven delivered a glowing
speech, which, however, was to the point, and was
received with much applause.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_654" id="Page_654">654</a></span>
Many words were not required at this meeting.
All were firmly resolved to make every effort and
every sacrifice to obtain satisfaction for those falsely
accused of shedding blood. This high-minded Jewish
assembly in London was somewhat similar to
that held in Alexandria exactly eighteen centuries
before, when Judaism, in the time of the Emperor
Caligula, was branded with disgrace by shameless,
diabolical enemies. At that time, also, the most
prominent Jews, famed for their culture, nobility of
mind, and wealth, gathered together. But the
Alexandrine assembly, surrounded by foes, had met
with terror and fear, whilst the one in London was
encouraged and supported by the good wishes and
sympathy of the citizens of the capital. In the second
Jewish congregation, that of Manchester, a similar
meeting was held.</p>

<p>Assured of success by these signs, Montefiore set
out on his important journey, provided with letters
of recommendation from prominent men in the
state, and accompanied by the good wishes of millions
of persons, foremost among them Queen
Victoria. On his departure she gave him audience,
and placed at his disposal her vessel in which to
cross the Channel&mdash;certainly an extraordinary mark
of favor and sympathy for the misfortunes of the
Jews, but at the time the feeling in their favor was
so strong, that it did not create great surprise.
Montefiore was accompanied by a gentleman of the
legal profession and by his wife Judith, who insisted
upon sharing her husband's hardships on this expedition
in the cause of her nation. She was the
ideal of a Jewish woman, cultured, noble-minded,
proud of her confession and devotedly attached to
her race, a brilliant contrast to the women of Berlin,
who had brought disgrace upon Judaism. Before
Montefiore and his escort left England, the two
chief rabbis of the German and Portuguese communities,
Solomon Herschel (died 1842), and David<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_655" id="Page_655">655</a></span>
Meldola, deemed it necessary to repeat the solemn
oath which Manasseh ben Israel and Moses Mendelssohn
had taken: that the blood accusation
against the Jews had not a shadow of support in
Talmudical writings, or in fact. In view of the
baseness of the clerical French party and the venality
of German newspapers, this oath was by no
means superfluous. Catholic agitators in France
and Belgium reviled the Jews, for a contemptible,
yet comprehensible reason, and with a definite plan
of entrapping the conscience of the free in their
nets. But the German writers acted in this way
from low motives, in order to utilize the misfortunes
of others as a source of wealth. A certain Dr.
Philibert had sent a letter to the house of Rothschild
in Paris, stating that for a large sum of money
he would undertake the defense of the Damascus
Jews in every European journal, adding the threat
that if this blood-money were refused he would influence
public opinion in the opposite direction. Such
miserable creatures were repulsed by the Jews with
scorn. They felt that they could rely upon their
own strength and the power of truth. Foiled in
their expectations, the contemptible scribblers
attacked the Jews, and increased the number of lies
and slanders which had accumulated around the
Damascus murder. The chief rabbis had therefore
to swallow their pride, and to take an oath on a
matter as clear as daylight.</p>

<p>However, if the Jews were attacked in the French
and German newspapers, England afforded them
sufficient cause to forget all the sufferings of the
Jews throughout fifteen centuries. Distinguished
merchants, proprietors of large banking-houses, and
members of parliament, about two hundred and ten
in all, preferred a request to the Lord Mayor of
London, Marshall, to call a public meeting and
enable them to express their feelings and their sincere
sympathy with the persecuted Jews in Damascus.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_656" id="Page_656">656</a></span>
The Lord Mayor, being of their opinion in
the matter, cordially assented, and a brilliant meeting
was held in London (in the Mansion House,
July 3) which was in itself a victory. Many ladies
of rank were among the audience. The chairman,
Thompson, remarked at the very outset:</p>

<blockquote>

<p>"The Jews of Damascus are as worthy of respect as those who
dwell among us in England. And of those I permit myself to say
that none of our fellow-citizens are more zealous in the spread of
humanity, in aiding the poor and oppressed, in protecting the orphan
and in promoting literature and knowledge than they are, and that
their benevolence is not only extended to the people who belong to
their own religion, but also to Christians, equally with members of
every creed."</p></blockquote>

<p>A member of Parliament named Smith, who rose
to move the first resolution, said:</p>

<blockquote>

<p>"I consider these charges as false as the natures of those who
invented them are cruel and evil. I am certain that the whole country
with one voice, and one accord, will rise to suppress such atrocities,
such barbarities, as have been carried on in Damascus. And
what people is it that has been subjected to such pain? A nation
connected with us by everything that religion holds dear and sacred;
a nation whose faith is based upon history, that awaits with unfaltering
confidence its political and religious restoration; a nation
closely bound up with the progress of trade and civilization throughout
the whole world, and in friendly intercourse with the whole
world.... In past times they were the men who led the way in
educating the human race, and granted to others that very civil and
religious freedom which at the present time they demand for themselves.
This nation has given the best proof of the value it sets upon
freedom, seeing that by its own example it has shown how greatly it
was actuated by this principle in its conduct towards others without
distinction of creed; it therefore has a claim to the highest tolerance."</p></blockquote>

<p>A prominent clergyman, Lord Howdon, added:</p>

<blockquote>

<p>"We often find in the mysterious ways of Providence that good
arises from evil, and therefore I, together with all the friends of mankind,
hope that the Parliament of this country, expressing its opinion
of this cruelty, will offer a recompense to the Jews for their sufferings
by legislation in their favor."</p></blockquote>

<p>The motion was carried unanimously:</p>

<blockquote>

<p>"That this meeting deeply deplores the fact that in this enlightened
age a persecution of our Jewish brethren could be set on foot by
ignorance and inflamed by bigotry."</p></blockquote>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_657" id="Page_657">657</a></span>
Towards the end of the meeting O'Connell entered.
He thought that his presence would be
required to arouse enthusiasm. But when he saw
that the zeal on behalf of the Jews had been raised
to a high pitch, he merely added:</p>

<blockquote>

<p>"After the testimony given to demonstrate the moral worth of the
Jews, could any man be so insane as to believe that they use blood
for their rites? Is not a Jew an example in every relation of life?
Is he not a good father, a good son? Are they not true friends?
Are they not honest, industrious?... I appeal to all Englishmen
to raise their voices in defense of the victims of that shameful oppression.
May the appeal go from one end of the British Isles to the
other, and if the concurrence of an Irishman be wanting, here am I
to testify to it."</p></blockquote>

<p>This three hours' meeting in the Mansion House
forms a noteworthy episode in Jewish history. In
the name of the meeting, the Lord Mayor communicated
the resolutions which were passed, not only
to the English government, but also to the ambassadors
of all European powers, requesting them at
the same time to obtain expressions of sympathy
with the Jews from their respective nations and
rulers. So effective was the result of unbiased public
opinion, that the emperor of Russia, Nicholas, as
well as the American Republic, felt themselves morally
compelled to express their abhorrence at tortures
inflicted on Jews.</p>

<p>A few weeks later a similar meeting was held in
Manchester, and, although most of the speakers
were clergymen, the same sentiments with regard
to the Jews were pronounced. Why had not such
views predominated in the fourth and fifth centuries,
when Christianity first became paramount? What
tears and bloodshed would have been avoided!
But the Jewish race was to be tested and strengthened
by martyrdom.</p>

<p>Montefiore was enabled to begin his journey filled
with courage. He was not only supported by the
government, but was accompanied by the sympathies
of the best men in England, and therefore he<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_658" id="Page_658">658</a></span>
felt hope. For Cr√©mieux the matter was not so
easy. In fact, he was hampered by the French
ministry. Thiers wished to show himself firm. Perhaps
he was not so much to blame as was generally
supposed; it is possible that Louis Philippe, who
was very cunning, hindered him from yielding. He
was reminded also in the Chamber of Peers (July
10) by honorable men, that by his defense of Ratti
Menton, he was compromising the honor of France,
but he continued in his ambiguous attitude. Events
brought the cunning of Thiers and the king to
naught. Whilst they thought that by petty intrigues,
childish obstinacy, and by deceiving Mehmet Ali
they were strengthening the position of France,
the four remaining European powers&mdash;England,
Russia, Austria, and Prussia&mdash;formed the Quadruple
Alliance (July 15) against France, which
agreed that Syria should be restored to the Sultan.
The downfall of Thiers was imminent, while he was
boasting of his successes.</p>

<p>A day before the conclusion of the alliance,
Montefiore and Cr√©mieux, with their respective
escorts, set out for Egypt. In Cr√©mieux's company
was Solomon Munk, who worthily represented Jewish
learning. Thus the Jewish embassy was not
lacking in what is requisite for the success of a great
enterprise&mdash;devotion, pure trust in God, eloquence,
and deep scholarship. In their journey through
France these noble-minded, gallant representatives
of Judaism were received with enthusiasm in the
Jewish communities, in Avignon, N√Æsmes, Carpentras,
and Marseilles, and were followed by good
wishes. In Leghorn, where the royal ship anchored,
the Portuguese community solemnly celebrated
the day of their landing. Every distinction among
the Jews disappeared in the unanimous admiration
for men who had undertaken so difficult a task, and
in the hope that they would succeed. All Israel was
once more of one heart and soul. Orthodox rabbis<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_659" id="Page_659">659</a></span>
allowed prayers for Montefiore and Cr√©mieux to be
interpolated in the Divine service. Every Jew,
even the most humble, was ready to bring some
sacrifice in order to lighten the task.</p>

<p>On arriving at Cairo (August 4), they hastened
on their mission, without taking any rest. Montefiore,
strongly supported by the English consul-general
Hodges, who had received instructions
from Palmerston to that effect, at once solicited an
interview with Mehmet Ali (August 6), by whom he
was received, and to whom he handed a petition in
the name of the Jewish community requesting permission
to go to Damascus and there conduct an
inquiry into the circumstances of the case. For this
purpose a safe-conduct was required for himself and
his friends, and also the privilege of speaking to the
prisoners as often as was necessary, and of hearing
evidence. Mehmet Ali was sorely perplexed. He
would willingly have acceded to this request, because
he earnestly wished to pose as a just prince before
the eyes of Europe. But the French consul-general
Cochelet&mdash;instructed by Thiers&mdash;checked this
inclination, and made every effort to prevent the
veil from being lifted. Cochelet, contrary to custom,
would not even introduce Cr√©mieux to the
Pasha. Cr√©mieux was therefore obliged to seek
an audience for himself; but, like Montefiore, he
received only evasive answers. The Eastern Question
had at that time become extremely perplexing.
Every moment Mehmet Ali was expecting the
final decision of the European powers, that he
should submit to the Sultan, surrender his independence,
and give up Syria. He did not wish to
break with those powers which took up the cause
of the Jews, more especially with England and
Austria, nor with Thiers, nor Louis Philippe, who
would not forsake Ratti Menton and the monks.
Owing to Mehmet Ali's indecision, matters dragged
on for three weeks. The Jewish envoys received<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_660" id="Page_660">660</a></span>
no definite reply. They were not discouraged, but
sought to devise new means by which to attain their
aim. Cr√©mieux hit upon the best plan. All the
European consuls, or as many as were willing to
sign a petition, were to demand the liberation of the
prisoners in Damascus. Nine consuls agreed to
this, in fact all except the French consul. Mehmet
Ali, however, obtained information of the proposed
petition, and in order that it might not appear that
he had yielded to the pressure of foreign powers,
through their representatives, he determined to
despatch an order to Damascus (August 28) that
the prisoners should forthwith be set at liberty.</p>

<p>The two envoys and their escort were filled with
heartfelt joy. The three synagogues in Alexandria
resounded with prayers of thanksgiving and blessings
for Mehmet Ali, Metternich, and the Austrian
consuls Laurin and Merlato, and all who had taken
part in the deliverance and who were delighted at
the result of their efforts.</p>

<p>Great was the astonishment, however, of the two
Jewish representatives, when a Turkish copy of
Mehmet Ali's order reached them, and Munk, who
was a skilled linguist, read out the words, "Mr.
Moses Montefiore and M. Cr√©mieux have besought
me to bestow mercy upon the Jews in Damascus
and to grant them liberty," which implied that
the accused Damascus Jews, though guilty, had been
treated by the Pasha with mercy, instead of justice.
The hand of Cochelet was visible in this attempt to
shield Ratti Menton and the monkish executioners.
Cr√©mieux straightway hastened to the Pasha, explained
to him how the expression "mercy" cast a
slur upon the accused, and with them upon all Jews,
because they were thus declared to be guilty. He
asked that the words "liberty and peace" be substituted.
Mehmet Ali ordered this alteration to be
made in the Firman, and thus the last intrigues of
Cochelet were destroyed.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_661" id="Page_661">661</a></span>
As soon as the order arrived at Damascus, Sherif
Pasha, who knew Mehmet Ali's severity, was obliged
to liberate the nine Jewish prisoners who were still
detained in jail (September 6) without consulting
Ratti Menton. Seven of the men had been mutilated
by the tortures, only two having escaped injury
who had suffered persecution, while four victims had
died. No sooner did the joyful news of their liberation
get abroad in Damascus, than all the Jews and
many Turks assembled before the prison, and accompanied
the sufferers to the synagogue, to offer up
thanks to God for their regained freedom, and to
pray for Mehmet Ali and their Jewish protectors.</p>

<p>The joy of the Jews in all parts of the world, on
hearing of the triumph of their just cause, may be
imagined; it was a national rejoicing, in which the
best men, both in Europe and Asia, participated.
All that remained to be effected was to obtain from
Mehmet Ali the official statement that the blood
accusation was a calumny, and of this there were
ample proofs when everyone in Damascus could
speak freely about the sad occurrence. The Jewish
envoys also made it their duty to induce the Pasha
to abolish torture altogether. But political complications
prevented the accomplishment of this humane
proposal. Mehmet Ali was obliged to surrender
Syria as well as Crete to Turkey. Thus punishment
overtook him for having complacently witnessed
for nearly three months the scenes of blood
in Damascus out of deference to France. Sherif
Pasha, even before Damascus was captured by the
Turks, was dragged in chains to Cairo, and there
executed, it is said for treason. Fran√ßois Salins,
one of the malicious French persecutors of the Jews
in Damascus, was torn to pieces by the mob. The
fanatical Catholics of this city, who under Mehmet
Ali had been permitted to practice so much cruelty,
were humiliated, or felt humiliated, when Raphael
Farchi, the distinguished Jew, was again installed<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_662" id="Page_662">662</a></span>
in his position as member of the city council. No
longer able to torture the Jews, they cooled their
hatred by inciting to a crusade against them. The
representative of the Greek Patriarch, the Armenian
bishop Vantabiet, the vicar of the Holy Land, the
Syrian priest Jacob, and the representative of the
Catholic Patriarch, the priest Maruni&mdash;in short, the
representatives of three sects who bore deadly hatred
against each other united in fastening a new calumny
on the Jews, who were hated equally by all three.</p>

<blockquote>

<p>"The Jews of Damascus allowed themselves grossly to insult the
Christians, to abuse them and subject them to all sorts of indignities.
Several persons made complaints of the disgraceful behavior of the
Jews, abominable behavior, which humiliates all Christians."</p></blockquote>

<p>The majority of European Christendom were,
however, sufficiently well acquainted with the veracity
of the clergy of Damascus to pay no attention
to this hypocritical lament, and the heads of Catholicism
felt ashamed of having exposed themselves in
the Damascus affair.</p>

<p>The Jewish envoys did not think their task completed,
unless they sought to prevent, as far as lay
in their power, the repetition of events which branded
all Judaism with dishonor. Foreseeing that Syria,
together with Damascus, would be restored to
Turkey, Montefiore made his way to Constantinople,
entered into communications with the Porte, to which
he had influential letters of recommendation, and
together with some distinguished Jews of the Turkish
capital obtained an audience of the Sultan, when
he asked for a Firman (November 6), which should
in future secure the Turkish Jews from blood accusations.</p>

<p>Cr√©mieux chose another field for his activity. The
martyrdom of the Damascus Jews had the unexpected
effect of strengthening the connection
between the Jews in Europe and those in the East.
The latter saw with astonishment how much their
European brethren could accomplish by means of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_663" id="Page_663">663</a></span>
culture, influence, and courage, and that they were
treated with distinction by princes and the great,
whilst they themselves bent their backs, unresistingly,
to every blow. This reverent admiration of
the Asiatic Jews for those of Europe, Cr√©mieux
utilized in the attempt to emancipate the Egyptian
Jews (or at least those in the two capitals of Alexandria
and Cairo) from their state of ignorance, and
render them susceptible to civilization. Their ignorance
of even Jewish writings, a consequence of the
immeasurable oppression under which they had
labored, as well as of their indescribable poverty,
was the cause of the intense contempt in which they
were held by Mahometans and Christians. From
this ignominy Cr√©mieux hoped to free them, and he
was powerfully supported by Solomon Munk, who
appears to have been destined to be the intermediary
between the European and the Egyptian Jews&mdash;between
the past and the present. Munk addressed
an eloquent Hebrew and Arabic circular letter (Elul
23) to the Jews of Egypt, in which he contrasted
the former splendor of the Jews of that country in
the time of the Second Temple, in the time of Philo
and Maimuni, when they stood at the head of Jewish
spiritual activity, with the darkness of their present
misery, the consequence of their intellectual decay.
He exhorted them to wake from their deathlike
torpor and establish schools, where their children
might obtain a knowledge of Judaism and of Jewish
literature, and at the same time a secular and practical
education. Munk effected for the Egyptian
Jews what Wessely had done for those of Europe.
But, unlike his predecessor, he was not denounced
as a heretic for his efforts. On the contrary, the
rabbi of Alexandria was the first to offer assistance
in the work. A distinguished Jew, named Valensino,
placed himself at the head of a society for establishing
schools and supervising public education. Then
Cr√©mieux, together with Munk, repaired to Cairo,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_664" id="Page_664">664</a></span>
where there dwelt a large congregation of about
300 families, only about twelve of whom were very
wealthy, while about 200 lived on charity. Here
also the rabbi, Moses Joseph Algazi, an aged man
of seventy-six, and a prominent man named Adda,
readily assisted in founding schools. Owing to
their exertions and those of other persons, two
schools for boys were opened in Cairo (October 4),
and one for girls; these were called the Cr√©mieux
schools. Here Munk succeeded in bringing about
an important reconciliation. In spite of the fanaticism
of the rigidly orthodox, he succeeded in having
the children of Karaites admitted to the schools,
there being only about a hundred persons of this
sect left in Cairo. The rabbi Algazi also supported
the innovation, which seemed to be a step tending
to restore brotherhood between Rabbanites and
Karaites. Stirred by these movements, the grand
rabbi of Constantinople (Chacham Bashi), Moses
Fresco, issued a circular letter (October 28) to the
Turkish congregations, urging that it was the duty
of the Jews to learn the language of the country
(Turkish), in order to meet the Sultan's wishes, who,
by his Firman Hatti-Sherif, had raised them from
their abject state. The mixed language in which
this circular letter of the Chacham Bashi was written
(Old Spanish with Hebrew and Turkish words),
proved sufficiently the necessity of a pure language
for the Jews.</p>

<p>However, these beginnings were merely seeds
scattered in the desert sand, and it was doubtful
whether they would take root and grow. The
efforts were resumed on a larger scale twenty years
later, under the name of "the Universal Alliance of
Israelites" (Alliance Isra√©lite Universelle). The
mission to Egypt produced practical and lasting
fruit for Jewish science, chiefly through Solomon
Munk (born at Glogau, 1802; died at Paris, 1867).
It is doubtful whether the spotless character of this<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_665" id="Page_665">665</a></span>
man, or his devoted attachment to science, is to be
more admired. He added to the number of great
men produced among the Jews during the first half
of the nineteenth century. His modesty was a
marked feature, which grew in proportion to the
increase of his scientific importance. For his
patience in misfortune, and cheerfulness in the sufferings
which he had incurred in the service of
science, he was greatly admired in his native country,
Germany, and in France, his adopted country,
and he was loved as much as he was revered.
Munk possessed all the virtues of the Jews without
their faults. In the comprehensive range of Arabic
literature he was one of the first masters of the day,
and the most profound scholars in the same study
recognized his equality, or awarded him the palm.
As interpreter to the escort of Cr√©mieux, he spoke
and wrote Arabic like one born in an Arab tent.
He divined the words and sense of any manuscript
passage by a kind of instinct, which only increased
in keenness when he lost his sight from poring
over manuscripts. His intellectual sight compensated
for the loss of his physical power. The darkness
which enshrouded him for nearly twenty years
before his death did not prevent his vision from
being clear and distinct.</p>

<p>The glory of Jewish history during the Middle
Ages developed during the rule of the Arabs in the
East and West; its dawn began with Saadiah, and
it reached its zenith with Maimuni. Munk banished
the obscurity in which this epoch had been
enwrapped, and illumined it with the full light of
his profound studies. The innermost thoughts of
Maimuni, the awakener of intellects, to whom the
Jewish race is chiefly indebted for its renaissance in
modern days, were completely revealed only through
the researches of Munk. He renewed in its original
form what had been spoilt by continual emendations.
The proud boast of Christendom, that even in the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_666" id="Page_666">666</a></span>
obscurity of the Middle Ages it had disseminated
the bright germs of thought, Munk controverted by
incontestable proofs that without Arabic and Jewish
philosophy, the darkness of the Middle Ages would
have been impenetrable, and that the so-called
Christian schools of philosophy of that period were
fed upon the crumbs which fell from the lips of
Jewish thinkers. Munk so conclusively established
this historical fact that it is scarcely possible to
speak of a Christian philosophy. Another historical
fact, the origin and development of the Karaite sect,
which, notwithstanding the powerful influence it
exercised upon thought in the Jewish Middle Ages,
was known only in rough outlines, was brought to
light by Munk; in a word, Jewish science is deeply
indebted to him. He not only greatly added to it
by his profound knowledge, but he also showed how
to pursue a sound course of investigation. As
Luzzatto opened up new Hebrew sources for Jewish
science, so Munk discovered new Arabic sources,
rendering them comprehensible and accessible, and
thereby greatly adding to the knowledge of Judaism,
which he loved with all his heart. Munk's sojourn
in Alexandria and Cairo was of extraordinary value
in his literary and historical researches. From that
soil, which had lain unproductive as to intellectual
results for many a day, he excavated rich treasures
for Jewish science. Munk fully recognized that the
self-respect of the Jews would be confirmed only by
self-knowledge, reached along the paths of science.</p>

<p class="center b2">1840&ndash;1870 <span class="smcap smaller">C. E.</span></p>

<p>The return from the East of the Jewish envoys, who
not only had saved a few men from death, but had
rescued all Judaism from disgrace, was a veritable
triumphal procession. From Corfu to Paris and
London, and even to the depths of Poland, the Jewish
communities were unanimous in expressions of
thanksgiving to the rescuers, and sought by visible
signs to evince their gratitude, and at the same time
show their patriotic sentiments for Judaism. The
tributes took the form of public orations, addresses,
articles written in every European language, naturally
also in Hebrew, and both in prose and verse.
Attentions and gifts were freely bestowed upon the
two chief representatives of Judaism, to celebrate in
a worthy fashion the momentous events which had
occurred in Damascus, and transmit the remembrance
of these deeds to posterity. Cr√©mieux, who
was the first to set out on the return journey,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_668" id="Page_668">668</a></span>
received enthusiastic homage in Corfu, Trieste,
Venice, Vienna, F√ºrth, Nuremberg, Frankfort, and
Mayence (November-December, 1840). The large
communities through whose cities he could not pass
sent deputations and addresses. It was na√Øvely
touching that old-fashioned orthodox rabbis, at a loss
how to show their gratitude, bestowed upon him the
title of Rabbi (Morenu), as the highest honor in
their gift. Only the Jewish community in Paris
behaved in a cool fashion, and prepared no fitting
reception for their emissary, as if fearing to wound
the sensitiveness of King Louis Philippe, whose
ambiguous attitude had been striking.</p>

<p>Montefiore, who had remained in Constantinople
a long time, in order to obtain a favorable Firman,
and who began his return journey later, and traveled
mostly by sea, did not come into contact with
so many congregations as Cr√©mieux, hence did not
receive so much public homage. He was, however,
overwhelmed with letters from all sides. By his
watchful care, continually directed to the welfare
and honor of his brethren, and without any idea of
reward, he had in his simplicity put their enemies to
shame. He obtained a promise from Cardinal
Rivarola, the protector of all Capuchins in Rome,
that the tombstone should be removed which had
been erected in the Capuchin church at Damascus
recording the murder of Father Tomaso by the
Jews, and representing him as a martyr. He also
compelled King Louis Philippe to appear pleased
with what had occurred. At an audience obtained
through the English ambassador, Lord Granville
(February 22, 1844), Montefiore handed the king a
copy of the Sultan's Firman which testified the innocence
of the Damascus Jews, and tacitly condemned
the French consul. Louis Philippe was compelled
to swallow this humiliation, and assume a gracious
manner for the sake of appearances, and congratulate
Montefiore on the success of his journey and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_669" id="Page_669">669</a></span>
his mission. Queen Victoria thanked Montefiore all
the more sincerely, through Lord Palmerston (who
was prime minister at the time, and to whom he
was presented on his return), for the succor which
he had brought his co-religionists.</p>

<p>The entire body of Jews in Europe were at this
time engaged in carrying out three objects: offering
to their two rescuers an enduring and striking
token of gratitude, perpetuating the memory of the
deliverance effected by them, and finally, discovering,
through combined action, a means whereby to
prevent the recurrence of similar false accusations
against Jews and Judaism. The leaders of the
German Jews felt themselves especially moved to
put on record their interest in the events, and their
admiration for the two noble representatives of their
race. They, the very ones who had hitherto taken
the lead in advocating progress, had done little in
connection with the sanguinary events of Damascus.
A prominent Jewish scholar, Zunz, had completely
refuted the alleged proofs, supposed to be drawn
from the Talmud, of the use of blood by the Jews.
The Jewish newspapers had boldly fought against
anti-Jewish attacks and slanders. But this was all
that had been done in Germany towards vindicating
the honor of Judaism. Riesser might easily have
joined Montefiore and Cr√©mieux, might have accompanied
them to Egypt as the representative of the
German Jews, and used his eloquence on behalf
of the sufferers; but no such idea was even suggested.
Geiger, from hatred to the Talmud, had
actually admitted that the anti-Semites were right
in attributing misanthropical expressions to the
Talmud. Certain high-minded Jews in Germany
felt it the more necessary to take public action in
the matter. Riesser, together with a few friends,
desired to found societies, through which the Jews
of the four chief countries of Europe were to offer
some public recognition to their two representatives.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_670" id="Page_670">670</a></span>
But this plan of acknowledging their indebtedness
fell through. In fact, the three objects desired by
the people were only imperfectly carried out,
because the right means to attain them were not
pursued. The services of Montefiore were, however,
acknowledged with fervent enthusiasm on his
return to London by a public celebration in the
synagogues, and a piece of plate was presented to
him in remembrance of his success. A still greater
distinction awaited him at the hands of Queen Victoria.
She rewarded him with an addition to his
armorial bearings (June 24), a great honor both to
his race and himself. Yet more important than
this toy for adults were the words of Her Majesty
that accompanied the gracious distinction:</p>

<blockquote>

<p>"Inasmuch as it was brought to our notice, that in consequence
of tidings from the East, which stated that, on account of the accusation
that they had murdered Father Tomaso, Jews in Damascus and
Rhodes had been imprisoned and tortured, that many children had
been thrown into prison and deprived of almost all nourishment, and
that many persons had been so cruelly tortured that death ensued,
... our trusty and well-beloved Sir Moses Montefiore, accompanied
by Lady Montefiore, had quite voluntarily journeyed to Alexandria
with the view of proving the falsehood of the charge and
of conducting the affairs of his unhappy and persecuted brethren;
that he succeeded in obtaining from the Pasha, Mehmet Ali, the honorable
liberation of the accused who were incarcerated, and the permission
for those who had fled the city to return home; that for this
purpose he procured a Firman in Constantinople from his Imperial
Majesty the Sultan Abdul Meg'id, which declared the innocence of
the Jews, and assured equal rights with all other subjects to members
of the Jewish religion under Turkish rule&mdash;we have taken the above
mentioned facts into our royal consideration, and desire to give to
Montefiore a special mark of our royal favor, in memory of his persevering
efforts on behalf of his suffering and persecuted brethren in
the East, and of his nation in general."</p></blockquote>

<p>It was an extract from the history of modern Jews
related by the Queen herself.</p>

<p>In comparison with this distinction, the proposal
of certain French congregations of the Upper Rhine
to strike a medal in honor of Cr√©mieux appears
very trivial. They shared the general idea, "that it
was important for future generations to perpetuate
the memory of the events of 1840 affecting Israelites."<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_671" id="Page_671">671</a></span>
But Cr√©mieux declined the medal. In what
manner these joyful, national memories were to be
immortalized was a matter concerning which there
was general indecision. Cr√©mieux asked the French
Jews and others to support the schools that he had
established in Alexandria and Cairo by their contributions.
Only a small amount, however, was
subscribed: the maintenance of the Cr√©mieux
schools in Egypt was only accidentally connected
with the main question, and was not likely to keep
the exaltation of the Jews at a high pitch. One
suitable proposition was made, but no notice was
taken of it.</p>

<blockquote>

<p>"It is not by ostentatious gifts, nor by clamorous celebrations, that
we can testify our gratitude. We would offer the finest testimonial to
the men who went to the rescue by perpetuating this great historical
event in a religious form appropriate to its religious spirit. It should
be commemorated by an annual festival equal to the festivals of
Chanuka and Purim; for on those days it may be said that Israel was
delivered from bodily suffering, whilst on this day it was delivered
from spiritual servitude."</p></blockquote>

<p>Judaism never knew a more effectual way of commemorating
its liberation and victories and arousing
a spirit of emulation in posterity than by establishing
days of memorial, by means of which, time, the
destroyer, is made the protector of historical events.
If that most skillful master of the Hebrew language,
Isaac Erter, had completed the narrative of the
persecution and the deliverance in Damascus, which
he had commenced in the simple biblical style, and
if the heads of the Jewish communities had resolved
to commemorate the most important day in the
Damascus affair, and to read this "Scroll" (Megillah)
in public, the lasting remembrance of these occurrences
would have been assured, and at the same
time a means would have been found of cementing
afresh the bonds of fellowship. The Jews of Asia
and Africa and on the whole globe would joyfully
have accepted such a festival as an international
memorial. Munk, whose voice carried great weight,
remarked:</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_672" id="Page_672">672</a></span></p>

<blockquote>

<p>"Would that the sad Damascus incident might at least serve to
make us take cognizance of our disorganized condition, which, though
mournful to contemplate, is unfortunately a fact. Would that it
might show us that in times of danger we must rely upon ourselves,
and that the bond that formerly united us might be renewed."</p></blockquote>

<p>Instead of unity, however, a rupture took place
within German Judaism, which, though caused by a
trifling dispute that might easily have been settled
in the commencement, grew to great proportions.
The consciousness of opposition was present, and by
chance it asserted itself on this occasion; but it might
equally well have shown itself at any other time,
so long as it was not allayed, or had not worn off.
The Hamburg Temple, which twenty years before
had first stirred up dissensions between the old-fashioned
orthodox party and the reformers, again
brought about a quarrel, which henceforth assumed
a fiercer complexion. The congregation of the
Temple had largely increased in numbers since its
foundation. The younger members of the old-fashioned
community had joined, because in the old
synagogue they found no satisfaction for their devotional
cravings, and they objected to the continual
disorder that prevailed. The new congregation
had already grown to nearly eight hundred members,
and included a man who in his own person was a
great attraction. After the death of Bresselau, the
secretary of the congregation, Gabriel Riesser had
accepted that post. He became closely connected
with the Temple, and was elected to the office of
second warden. As his name was in extraordinary
repute, owing to his untiring zeal for the political
and social emancipation of the Jews in Germany,
his adhesion to the Temple shed new luster upon it.
When the members of the Temple determined to
erect a new and larger house of prayer, the old
party by complaining to the senate threw obstacles
in the way of the undertaking. The authorities of
the Temple had also caused a new prayer-book to
be compiled.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_673" id="Page_673">673</a></span>
The altered liturgy of the Temple was published
and announced as a general "Prayer-Book for
Israelites," but was so objectionable to the orthodox
party as to be utterly rejected. The circumstance
that the new prayer-book claimed to be used by all
Jews gave rise to great annoyance. Chacham Bernays
therefore renewed on a Sabbath, in the three
synagogues (Marcheshvan 1, October 16, 1841),
the proclamation against heretics which the three
rabbis had issued on the foundation of the Temple,
forbidding any Israelite to use this prayer-book.
In the reasons assigned, harsh expressions were
employed charging that this prayer-book, even more
than the former, gave wanton and frivolous treatment
to the religious convictions contained in the
Hebrew prayers. This denunciation naturally
excited the Temple congregants, and transported
even the cautious Riesser to inordinate lengths.
Whilst the preachers regarded the insulting expression
of opinion from a religious standpoint, Riesser
saw in it an encroachment upon their rights,
"because the Chacham had no authority over the
Temple." The Temple committee then published
a counter-declaration (October 24), in which Bernays
was charged not alone with "arrogance, impotent
partiality, and malicious ignoring of the contents
of the book," but with "ignorance of all theological
and liturgical literature." There now arose
a violent dispute, conducted with such passion, that
the senate was compelled to reprove both parties.
The Chacham and the leaders of his congregation,
who sided with him, circulated thousands of copies
of the sentence of condemnation upon the prayer-book
in many communities; whilst the authorities
of the Temple (November) requested rabbis and
preachers holding the same religious views to give
their opinions as to the value or worthlessness of
the innovations, expecting that the decisions would
be in their favor. On this occasion, the changes<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_674" id="Page_674">674</a></span>
which had taken place in the German communities
during two decades became evident. Whereas
formerly only three rabbis had ambiguously given
their assent to the ritual of the Temple, and many
others had condemned it, at this second discussion
only the rabbi of Altona supported Bernays, whilst
twelve or thirteen others pronounced judgment
adverse to him; this was at the close of 1841, or
the beginning of 1842. Then began the aggressive
stage of the reform movement. Young rabbis or
clergymen, pastors (as they preferred to be called),
who had mostly drawn their wisdom from academies,
and were enthusiastic for the reform which had
become the fashion, now were at the head. The
old rabbis, on the other hand, no longer ventured to
oppose them. Thus it seemed as if all the Jews of
Germany were in favor of innovations in the synagogue,
and only a few wanting in spirit struggled
against this tendency.</p>

<p>The contest concerning the Hamburg Temple
bore no results in the city itself, as a terrible conflagration
(May, 1842) transformed a great part of
the town into a mass of ruins, and distracted attention
from party interests. The flame of reform
blazed up from another point, and threatened to
spread far and wide. In Frankfort-on-the-Main,
for some time past, there had been discontented
persons who had broken away from the Judaism of
the day. These disturbing elements partly originated
in a school called the Philanthropin (which
from small beginnings had grown into an important
institution), partly in the first Jewish Freemasons'
lodge. The managers and teachers of the school
and the members of the lodge favored a radicalism
repugnant to Judaism. For a long time Michael
Creizenach (born 1789, died 1842), a teacher at the
Philanthropin, formed the center of an invisible
society. Creizenach, who was honest, judicious,
but uninteresting, had published many pamphlets<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_675" id="Page_675">675</a></span>
combating Rabbinical Talmudical Judaism, but
owing to their temperate tone and want of depth,
these writings made little impression. By his personal
influence, however, he filled the circle of his
friends and admirers with a passion for innovation
and a deep aversion to antiquity.</p>

<p>After his death several of his adherents endeavored
to form a congregation, and to establish a sect,
even at the risk of separating from Judaism. Their
aim was in a measure to remove the pretext of
anti-Jewish politicians, who withheld equal rights
from the Jews on the score of attachment to their
nationality, to the Talmud, and to old forms, and they
also desired to secure freedom of action for themselves.
They were educated laymen, who, owing
to the prevailing confusion, had lost mental balance,
or they may have been misled by false
leaders. They constituted themselves a Society of
the Friends of Reform (October, 1842), and drew up
a confession of faith, which clearly proved the perplexity
of the times. They refused to recognize the
Talmud as an authority. But the Bible? "They
considered the Mosaic religion capable of continual
development." First of all they wished to throw
off the fetters of the dietary laws, because they "had
originated in the ancient constitution of the state,"
and at the present day had lost their significance as
a religious act or symbol. They definitely gave up
all hope in the Messiah, or a return to Palestine,
"because they regarded their native land as their
sole fatherland."</p>

<p>The Creizenach Friends of Reform did not find
many supporters. They therefore sought to interest
Gabriel Riesser, whose importance was already
acknowledged, and who might attract others. He
was at first inclined to join them. He appears not
to have overcome the excitement into which he had
been thrown by Bernays' intervention in the affairs
of the Hamburg Temple. He did not even shrink<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_676" id="Page_676">676</a></span>
from total secession, although he had hitherto constantly
desired to have "the shell of Judaism
respected on account of its soul." The idea of
freedom, which completely filled his mind, destroyed
his emotional attachment to existing Judaism. He
was therefore eminently in favor of the paragraph
in the Creizenach or Frankfort programme which
declared that it was optional with every Jewish
father to have his sons circumcised, and that in case
of the omission of this rite civil disabilities should
not be entailed. Riesser wished to combat any presumptive
right of forcing conscience. However,
others who had been asked to join, took umbrage at
this very question of circumcision. The founders of
the Society of the Friends of Reform, therefore, saw
themselves obliged to relinquish this point as well as
the declaration against the dietary laws, and to adhere
to only three out of the five resolutions of their
original programme: that against the Talmud, that
against the Messiah, and that enunciating the possibility
of the development of the "Mosaic religion."
This abridgment and enfeebling of the original confession,
Riesser considered illogical and cowardly, and
he withdrew his support. The power of attraction
was lacking in the society, and as only a few joined,
it perished at its birth. The question of circumcision
was shortly afterwards brought forward from
another quarter. Several unfortunate accidents at
the circumcision of Jewish boys had induced the
health officers in Frankfort-on-the-Main to issue an
order (February 8, 1843) with the ambiguous wording,
"Israelite citizens and inhabitants, if they desire
to have their children circumcised, must employ the
services of competent persons." From this it
appeared that the Frankfort Senate made it optional
with Jewish parents to perform the rite or neglect
it, and did not regard it as a necessary mark of the
Jewish religion. The Senate at the same time
explained that they did not mean thereby to give<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_677" id="Page_677">677</a></span>
untrammeled liberty to the innovators. But the
reformers seized upon the words in order to have a
pretext for abolishing the rite of circumcision. In
consequence, Rabbi Solomon Trier invited the opinions
of his brother rabbis upon the subject (1843&ndash;44)
in order to dispose of the question forever. However,
it caused but a slight sensation, seeing that
even young rabbis favorably disposed to reform had
decisively asserted the obligation and necessity of
circumcision. Therefore, no seceding sect was
formed among the Jews of Germany, although the
elements existed, and an uneasy state of feeling was
the result.</p>

<p>This feeling was especially noticeable among the
younger rabbis, who were not very clear about the
purpose and extent of the reforms to be instituted,
or met with continual opposition on one side or the
other in their congregations, and in their isolation
were without support. At this time the fashion of
assemblies and societies had come into vogue;
railways had already been built between the great
cities, and had facilitated personal intercourse. Thus
the invitation calling a conference of rabbis met
with approval. This meeting of rabbis and preachers
who were, to some extent, at one upon the subjects
under discussion, at first awakened a certain expectancy;
it was a novelty, and this always possesses a
certain amount of charm. However, at the first
session only twenty-two rabbis assembled in Brunswick,
the majority coming from southern and western
Germany. The remainder waited until the resolutions
of the assembly should be made known, and
according as they agreed or disagreed with them,
they would decide whether to join or to hold aloof.
Few rabbis attended who adhered to the Judaism
rooted in the Talmud; most of the members had
partially, or wholly, severed themselves from the
Talmud, although they did not practically manifest
this severance in their religious practices.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_678" id="Page_678">678</a></span>
The first Rabbinical Assembly was dominated by
a man possessing all the qualities calculated to widen
the breach and bring about a complete separation.
This was Samuel Holdheim (born at Kempen, 1806;
died at Berlin, 1860). It is a curious yet natural
fact that Talmudism, which had acquired its power
and extensive range through Polish students, should
be attacked by a Pole with unsparing severity. On
emerging from boyhood Holdheim displayed not
only extraordinary acquaintance with the Talmud
and Rabbinical literature, but also such remarkable
versatility in dialectics and the art of discussion that
he won the admiration of grey-bearded rabbis, and
was considered a highly-skilled Talmudist.</p>

<p>Like Solomon Maimon, Holdheim when he already
had a son began his secular education in the academy
at Prague, skipping the lower grades. All that he
heard in the philosophical lecture-rooms in this not
very distinguished university was new to him,
astounded and dazzled him, and resulted in great
perturbation of mind. He quickly assimilated such
elements of knowledge as were connected with his
previous acquirements, such as Christian theology
and the commonplace philosophy tolerated in Austria
under Metternich. But he had no appreciation of
solid, disciplining branches of learning, and even
the subjects which attracted him he had first to
reproduce in a Talmudical form. Holdheim's knowledge
therefore was only of a fragmentary nature,
and contained numerous gaps. He was, however,
sufficiently careful and practical to devote himself
to useful work, to acquire a good style, which had
been neglected in his education, and cultivate
pulpit eloquence. Owing to his poverty, he was
compelled to devote himself to professional studies,
and was thus unable to spend time upon his favorite
subjects. The Bible which had hitherto been a
closed book to Holdheim, or had only been examined
by him through Talmudical glasses, he studied solely<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_679" id="Page_679">679</a></span>
to obtain verses for his sermons. It is not granted
to everyone to possess ideals and regulate his conduct
by them. There must also exist dry, calm,
doubting natures, occupied only with the world of
real things, who build themselves huts here below,
and look with contempt on all sublime and ideal sentiments
as being froth and folly. Such Mephistophelian
temperaments, the incarnation of the spirit of
doubt, are as necessary in the sphere of moral life
as opposition in nature. Holdheim had this tendency,
and his Talmudical culture nourished and developed
it. He knew of no enthusiasm, neither for the calm
light of pale memories, nor for the dim, cloudy
dreams of the future. The firm ground of the
present was more to his taste. Since Judaism consists
of memories and hopes, Holdheim was not
heart and soul devoted to it, but sought to remodel
and alter it, so that he might not be inconvenienced.</p>

<p>Mecklenburg-Schwerin, where the typical brutality
of the Middle Ages had been preserved, and where
mere caprice wielded the scepter, was at this time
ruled by a prince, who, instead of making his Jews
free in action, wished them to be Freethinkers.
They were to cast off all old memories and forms
and remodel themselves. A superintendent was
appointed for the disciplining of the congregations,
and Holdheim was made chief rabbi (1840) to assist
in reforms, and stamp innovations with the rabbinical
seal. Here he felt untrammeled, and could
abolish whatever was distasteful to him. He who
formerly had had no conception that divine service
must possess dignity, now discovered that disorder
in the synagogue was unseemly, and determined to
remove everything not countenanced by the spirit
of the times. As, however, a desire for changes in
the synagogue did not originate from any impulse
of his own, he looked around for patterns, and introduced
the W√ºrtemberg ritual, undisturbed by any
consideration as to whether he was forcing the consciences<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_680" id="Page_680">680</a></span>
of the mostly old-fashioned orthodox congregations.</p>

<p>But Holdheim was not to win laurels by introducing
innovations into the synagogue. He marked
out a wider field for himself. He wished to alter the
whole of Judaism in its threefold form, with its Biblical,
Talmudical, and Rabbinical components, to
confuse all ideas and stultify the consciences. Since
Paul of Tarsus, Judaism had not known such an
enemy in its midst, who shook the whole edifice to its
very foundations. But Holdheim possessed no original
ideas to use as a lever for overthrowing Judaism:
he had only a certain ingenuity which he had
gained from the Talmud. He was therefore obliged
to make use of such thoughts of others as had
become public property. His acute intellect, however,
enabled him to piece together these disjointed,
half true premises, and give them a coloring of
truth. Judaism, he said, consists of a close combination
of religious and moral ideas with national
and political elements. Holdheim accepted this
definition in order to separate the religious from the
national ordinances, the latter having lost all significance
since the downfall of the Jewish state.
Which laws are national and therefore temporary?
Holdheim gave a wide application to the term, calling
all observances national and political which are
inconvenient, and require a certain amount of self-denial,
such as keeping the Sabbath, the Jewish laws of
marriage, and even the acquisition of the Hebrew
language, which he desired to banish from the
midst of the Jewish race, because it is a national
bond of union; and still more national is a hope in
the Messiah. To this sophistry Holdheim added
other quibbles. He considered every state, however
constituted, even Russian despotism, an all-devouring
Moloch which continually demands victims,
and whose lust for sacrifices can be satisfied
only by the abnegation of independence, freedom,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_681" id="Page_681">681</a></span>
and every religious sentiment. The culminating
point of Holdheim's theory was that Talmudical
Judaism itself, in the expression "the law of the
state is law for the Jews" (in civil relations), obliges
every Jew to subordinate his religious affairs to
those of the state; Judaism, in other words, prescribes
its own suicide, if the state provides it with
a silken halter. Had he lived in the time of the
Maccabees, Holdheim would have joined the renegade
Menelaus in urging the Jews to worship the
Greek Zeus, because the state, which was then
called Antiochus Epiphanes, had so commanded.
In the time of Hadrian, like a second Acher, he
would have lauded the cult of Jupiter of the Capitol,
and in the days of Philip of Spain and Emanuel of
Portugal he would have advocated the worship of
the cross. The millions of Jewish martyrs, according
to his theory, were malefactors against the
state, inasmuch as they had opposed the laws given
to them. Holdheim, the son of the Talmud, struck
down Talmudical Judaism with the weapons which
it had bestowed upon him. The authority and power
which the legislative Synhedrion had formerly
possessed, or is said to have possessed, Holdheim
wished to see transferred to the Christian state,
even the right of interfering with matters of conscience.
These ideas he propounded with sophistic
casuistry, unmistakably according to the method of
the Polish Rabbinical school. It was difficult for
Holdheim to decide what Judaism actually was, and
what would be left of it, after everything in any way
connected with national political life had been excluded,
and when supreme authority was besides
vested in each state, to change, command, or prohibit
religious practices.</p>

<p>The majority of the members of the first assemblage
of rabbis in Brunswick looked upon Holdheim
with awe as a Talmudical scholar and a reckless reformer,
and he obtained distinct influence over the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_682" id="Page_682">682</a></span>
discussions and resolutions of the meeting. Less
attention was paid to the letter and spirit of Judaism
"than to the state, the exalted German governments,"
and the intangible, whimsical "spirit of the
age." The Talmud was sacrificed by most of the
delegates as a scapegoat. Yet the debates and
conclusions of the Brunswick conference of rabbis
(June, 1844) produced but little effect. The congregations
troubled themselves as little about it
as they did about the protest from seventy-seven
rabbis of Germany, Bohemia, Moravia, and Hungary,
which, set on foot by an upright, self-sacrificing,
disinterested, but bigoted zealot, Hirsch Lehren
of Amsterdam, utterly condemned the assembly of
Brunswick.</p>

<p>Events in the Christian world at about this time
demonstrated more effectually than this laboriously
constructed protest, that Judaism with its ancient
confession had not yet become superfluous. The
exhibition of the pretended holy coat of Jesus in
Treves, to which more than a million Catholics from
all countries made a pilgrimage and bent the knee
(August-October, 1844), showed that the "spirit
of the age" was a deceptive standard. In consequence
of this excess of medi√¶val superstition and
credulity, there arose in Germany what promised to
be an influential anti-Catholic movement. A German
Catholic Church was established (January,
1845), and next to it, in the bosom of Protestantism,
"Communities of the Friends of Light" were
formed, who threatened Christianity, its belief in the
Trinity, and the Divine Incarnation, with imminent
dissolution. Every period has its delusions, and
Jews can always be found ready to imitate strange
customs. Here and there voices were raised in
favor of founding a German Jewish Church after the
pattern of the German Catholic. In Breslau the
agitation for this new scheme was only artificially
kept alive, but this movement was somewhat more<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_683" id="Page_683">683</a></span>
energetic in Berlin. In this city a popular preacher,
Stern, had been delivering lectures upon Judaism
and Jewish history, and had characterized Jewish
doctrines as a capricious system. At his suggestion,
some twenty men, whose opinions upon these
topics were in accord with his own, assembled for
the purpose of establishing a sort of Church system
of a peculiar type, called the Reform Association
(April 2, 1845). They believed that the majority
of German Jews had disowned all attachment to
ancient Judaism in their hearts, and would gladly
adopt a new creed. The founders of the Berlin
Reform Association therefore issued a summons to
all Israel to attend a synod, in order to establish a
new Jewish religion. In their programme they naturally
tabulated only negative principles, such as
the rejection of the Talmud and of the Messianic
doctrine, because they belonged with body and soul
to their Berlin home; they advocated a return to
Holy Writ, not to its literal sense, but to its spirit.
The affirmative principles were: "We desire faith,
positive religion, Judaism." The confusion of ideas
at this time was as great as when the Christian
communities of old were first originated from semi-Jewish
elements, and even clear heads became
affected.</p>

<p>The matter did not, however, result in a synod
for the discussion of reform, which would indeed
have marked the Jews as slavish imitators of the
Church and of the "Friends of Light." The speeches
in favor of the movement made in various quarters
proved full of hollow phrases. The Berlin Society
adhered to its programme, and as this found no
favor in the eyes of the masses, it was to be ratified
by the second Rabbinical Convention held in Frankfort
(July, 1845), as being in consonance with
Judaism.</p>

<p>This Assembly aroused greater excitement and
fiercer passion than the first, because, on the one<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_684" id="Page_684">684</a></span>
hand, the Berlin Reform Union participated in it,
in order to infuse their own spirit or to effect its
downfall, whilst, on the other hand, a skillful leader
of the orthodox party temporarily joined it, in order
to show how Judaism should be purified, or to
throw obstacles in the way, if the Reformers should
seem to rush to reckless extremes. The orthodox
leader was Zachariah Frankel (born 1801, died
1875). He somewhat resembled Holdheim. Both
were profoundly learned in the Talmud, and both
acquired their secular education when advanced in
years, but their points of dissimilarity were yet
more striking. In Holdheim's character the prominent
features were his innate or acquired love of
scoffing at, and his utter contempt for, the past. In
Frankel one is struck by the moral earnestness
which, together with his warm-heartedness, rendered
him worthy of respect by his true regard for inherited
forms, his conscientiousness in every matter,
and his firm but somewhat peculiar character.
Holdheim loved the present and the practical,
Frankel the future and the ideal: the former strove
to erase from men's memories all traces of the
Talmud and Rabbinical Judaism, if not of Judaism
altogether; whilst the latter justified and glorified
the Talmud. The main aim of Frankel's scientific
activity was to demonstrate that Talmudical tradition
was correct, and that another Talmud had been
known even before ours. He sought traces of this
original tradition in the ancient Greek translation
of the Pentateuch, in the compositions of the two
Jud√¶o-Greek authors, Philo and Josephus, and
especially in non-Talmudical sources. Such comprehensive
studies were possible only in a man of
his marvelous intellectual power and wonderful
constitution.</p>

<p>Although Frankel labored to maintain the glory
of the Talmud and to prove that reverence was due
to Jewish antiquity, he was not averse to religious<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_685" id="Page_685">685</a></span>
reforms, nor was he blind to the necessities of modern
times. However, although he would not recognize
the claim of an individual to institute reforms,
he was ready to appeal to a scientific tribunal and
the voice of the people, the whole Jewish world.
He did not desire to revive obsolete forms into a
semblance of life, even though they had formerly
been of importance, and was willing to abolish such
existing customs as scientific inquiry pronounced to
be unjustified or hurtful. Frankel wished to see a
conference of rabbis, or, more correctly, of notables
in the foremost rank of Jewish learning, so that the
chasm between the old and the new systems might
be bridged over. He therefore joined the assembly
of rabbis at Frankfort, hoping to counteract the
eager desire for reform by the weight of his name,
which, owing to his distinguished position as a
writer, was already famous, and to aid in guarding
against imprudent measures, or at least in modifying
them. Like Holdheim and Geiger, who brought
their programmes of reform with them, he brought
his, and in it he endeavored to reconcile antiquity
with progress.</p>

<p>Harassed by the contending influences of Frankel
and the reformers, the conference grew vacillating.
The first motion brought forward, which was not
wholly unexpected, that the Hebrew language
should, if possible, be eradicated from the minds
and memories of the whole Jewish race, obliged
Frankel to sever his connection with the assembly
publicly, and the applause that his conduct called
forth revealed the fact that the Rabbinical Convention
did not represent the entire body of the German
Jews, but only a small, active party. Unconsciously
the Frankfort Assembly had lost its balance. Its
members were obliged to dissemble before the
Reform Society. They had to praise its actions, or
they would have lost its support. On the other
hand, they did not dare openly to espouse its hollow<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_686" id="Page_686">686</a></span>
views, or they would have lost favor with the congregations.
A subterfuge helped them out of this
perplexity; they promised to support the efforts of
the Reform Association to the utmost, if the latter
would "agree with the principles by which they
thought reform in Judaism ought to be guided,"
which sounded like a hidden reproach.</p>

<p>The Reform Society was not repelled by this
partial condemnation; they knew that the leaders
of the conference, especially Holdheim, sided with
them, and they deceived themselves with the
delusion that they were creating an essentially
new form of Judaism. They formed themselves
into a congregation of about two hundred members,
and celebrated a consecration (April 2, 1846), when
Holdheim as high priest offered up clouds of incense.
The congregation and their pastor were well fitted
for each other, and however much they resisted at
first, in the end they had to embrace in friendship.
Thus a "German Jewish Church" was established
with a temple, a preacher, and a ritual of its own.
It seemed as if time had gone back some seventeen
centuries, and that they were in some town of Syria,
or Asia Minor, or in Rome, when, out of the conflict
of ancient Judaism with semi-Christian and semi-pagan
elements, new congregations had arisen,
retaining only faint traces of Judaism. The new
customs prevailed in the Reform Temple in Berlin.
Praying with uncovered heads especially marked it
as of foreign growth, and repulsed even some who
otherwise approved of reform. Hebrew was retained
only in a few prayers and in the readings from the
Pentateuch. The Reform Temple, in fact, assumed
a Germanic tinge, and threw off its Jewish cosmopolitan
character. The trace of its Jewish origin
was visible only in the divine service; in their mode
of living the members could not be recognized as
the descendants of Jews. Perhaps Holdheim was
even more fanatically desirous of seeing every Jewish<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_687" id="Page_687">687</a></span>
custom abolished than his free-thinking congregants.
He disregarded not alone Rabbinical Judaism
and the Talmud, but also duties ordained by the
Holy Scripture. But even in the reform community
it was evident that Jewish self-reliance had progressed
greatly since the time of Friedl√§nder. The
reform party had completely overcome its inclination
towards Christianity. Of its constituents, who number
one thousand souls, not one member nor any of
their children joined the Christian Church. They
do not desire to be considered a separate sect, but
as an integral element of the Jewish race.</p>

<p>The Berlin reformers, however, remained isolated,
and found no following in Europe. In their own
midst, a lukewarm spirit crept in, sooner even than
their opponents had anticipated. From want of
visitors to the house of prayer, the Sabbath worship
had to be transferred to Sunday, the same change
that had been made by the Jewish Christians in the
first century. The question of Sunday worship cannot
be discussed here; it belongs to the immediate
present. Such lukewarmness and lack of interest
should have convinced the founders, who lived to
witness them, that they had committed some mistake.
To give an account of this blunder in its
entirety cannot be attempted in this history; it
would be overstepping the bounds of a record of
events. One circumstance, however, must not be
forgotten, that the Berlin Society of Reform had an
antagonist in its vicinity. This enemy, of whom it
had taken no account, was the more dangerous, as
he used his incisive eloquence and every fiber of
his being to protest against the new sect founded by
the Berlin Committee. This opponent was Michael
Sachs, who was born at Glogau, 1808, and died at
Berlin at the beginning of 1864.</p>

<p>If bountiful nature had determined to create a
thorough contrast to Holdheim, she succeeded in
Sachs. Externally, mentally, in appearance, speech,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_688" id="Page_688">688</a></span>
attitude, and tendency of mind, in his learning and
character, even in habits and fancies&mdash;in everything
the two men were so totally opposed, that at first
sight they could hardly be recognized as members
of the same race, devotees of the same calling. If
Holdheim represented the Jewish Polish spirit, strung
to the highest pitch by Talmudical dialectics, Michael
Sachs called to mind the Jewish emigrants from the
Pyrenean peninsula, ennobled by classic forms and
√¶sthetic teachings. He resembled the noble Isaac
Cardoso, or Isaac de Pinedo, or any one of the numerous
poets and scholars of Marrano lineage in
Holland and Italy, who combined deep devotion to
Judaism with taste for poetical or philological studies.</p>

<p>Owing to his peculiar nature, and the twofold
influence exercised upon his mind by Hebrew and
Greek literature, Sachs became an ideal personality,
like Gebirol and Jehuda Halevi, who could flourish
only upon the clear heights of existence, and felt
physical disgust at everything of a mean character.
There was no equivocation in him; feeling, thought,
and action all flowed from one source. He was,
therefore, mercilessly bitter against falsehood, ambiguity,
and hypocrisy, against all ostentation and
pomposity, against noisy hollowness and vanity;
he scourged them with the lash of his words and
with his striking, brilliant wit. Noble-minded and
self-sacrificing to a fault, humble before God and
before man as bearing the impress of the Divine,
Sachs was proudly repellent to all who in religion,
art, science, or public life use counterfeit coin, and
conceal their own self-seeking petty interests under
the veil of a general, large purpose. If Sachs in
respect to convictions, character, moral elevation,
capacity for self-denial, and devotion to duty and
his faith, was thoroughly Jewish, in his deep love of
beauty he was Hellenic, and in his person contradicted
the alleged impossibility of this dual nature,
which had been asserted by Heine. Whatever was<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_689" id="Page_689">689</a></span>
ugly, inharmonious, or ungainly, was as repugnant
to him as the immoral and the untrue.</p>

<p>Judaism was dearest to his heart, for he considered
it a revelation from the God who directs mankind,
and the embodiment of all that is exalted and
sacred; and he would not allow it to be subtly
explained away by the philosophy of the times.
Sachs did not fail to observe the objectionable
excrescences which had arisen on its surface, but he
knew their origin, and believed that time, which had
produced, would destroy them. He hesitated, however,
to lay hands upon them, for fear of injuring
the sound, whilst removing the unsound and decayed
parts. He would not trust himself, nor any one,
with the task of making innovations. This suspicion
of decisive reforms originated partly in his aversion
to active measures, which was one of his failings.
As he was only human he could not be
without faults. Another error, which avenged itself
upon him and the party he represented, was his
unconquerable dislike to uniting for common action
even with those who shared his opinions. Sachs
would have joyfully subordinated himself to leaders
whose loftiness of mind could have inspired him
with respect. But as he found no such characters
among his contemporaries, he would not attach
himself to men in no way superior to himself, or
who did not even attain to his own height. Thus
he was equally unfit to be a party-leader and a partisan.</p>

<p>Sachs' great qualities and small failings forced
his vocation upon him: he was destined for the pulpit.
The easy stream of his eloquence, his depth
of feeling, warmth of conviction, grace of gesture,
the charm that he exercised when interpreting the
prophets and Agadists, the brilliant wit at his command,
the beauty of his voice and his smooth diction&mdash;all
combined to make him unsurpassed by the
best preachers of his time, and his only equal was<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_690" id="Page_690">690</a></span>
Mannheimer. When standing in the pulpit, Sachs
appeared to be transfigured and oblivious of himself;
it seemed as if one of the prophets of God
were exhorting the people, or encouraging the
despondent by his tidings of an ideal future. Even
those of his hearers who did not share his convictions
were carried away by his eloquence, and were
compelled to yield him a tribute of praise. Sachs,
however, was a persuasive speaker not only in the
pulpit, but also in ordinary conversation. His
speech overflowed with the warmth of the sentiments
which filled his heart. His impressive words,
which issued from the depths of his being, attracted
many faithful adherents to Judaism. Whosoever
came into contact with him was drawn into a magic
circle, and absorbed somewhat of his convictions.
His influence was the greater because he never
made an effort to persuade; he simply spoke out
what was in him. Nothing was more hateful to
him than the display of official dignity, sham devotional
fervor, and the pastoral airs copied from
Christian clergymen.</p>

<p>In Prague, where he roused the German-speaking
inhabitants, both Christians and Jews, to a high
pitch of enthusiasm, a happy chance brought him
into contact with Rapoport (1840&ndash;44), one of the
founders of Jewish science. An intimate friendship
sprang up between these two men, whose education
had been conducted on such different lines, and
Sachs was introduced by his friend into the rich
domain of Jewish literature, which had hitherto been
only in part accessible to him, as his attention had
been concentrated on the study of the Holy Scriptures
and on classical literature. His talent of
vividly perceiving the essential and excellent elements
of a subject and storing them in his brain,
soon made him master of this new material, and
enabled him to impart it to a wide circle in a refined
form. But Sachs never became fully acquainted<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_691" id="Page_691">691</a></span>
with the dialectics of the Talmud, which was Holdheim's
strong point, and this territory remained
foreign to him. Though he deeply lamented this
deficiency in his knowledge, it was no real defect,
for such studies did not accord with the Hellenic
side of his nature, and would have blighted the
blossoms of his genius. As though destined to
counteract the influence of the Jewish German
Church, which was to assume form in Berlin, and to
become the opposite pole to Holdheim's endless
negations, he was elected by the congregation of
Berlin as preacher and rabbi. Here, by instilling
into the minds of his congregants the same Jewish
confidence with which he was inspired, and a feeling
of righteous pride in belonging to so ancient, noble,
and cultured a race, he succeeded to some extent in
curing them of their inclination to Christianity, and
the evil habit of imitation to which they had so long
been subject. This change in thought, which affected
the most remote circles, weakened the antipathy
towards the Jews of Berlin, which since the time of
Friedl√§nder had prevailed in other communities.
Sachs was included among the most distinguished
personages of the Prussian capital; the cultured
Christian world lavished attentions on him, although
he did not seek them. Had he given vigorous and
energetic effect to his words, and created permanent
institutions&mdash;for which plenty of opportunity
would have been given him by the liberal Berlin
community&mdash;perhaps the reform congregation might
not have arisen.</p>

<p>He combated the reform tendency with all his
strength. In Holdheim and his allies he beheld
only perverters of Judaism and false leaders of the
people, and he openly expressed this opinion, for,
as he often remarked, "Against insult and harsh
words I am hardened and indifferent." From the
pulpit he wielded the scourge of his annihilating
scorn against the Jewish German Church, which had<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_692" id="Page_692">692</a></span>
so limited the development of Judaism, that it could
be contained in a nutshell. But even his opponents
admitted that he employed only honorable weapons,
the use of others being at variance with his noble
nature. He did great harm to the Reform Temple.
Persons who had heard Sachs' sermons were wearied
by those in the reform synagogue. A comparison
between Sachs and his opposite, Holdheim,
who was a contrast to him in every way, always
resulted in favor of the former. Whilst the Temple
where Holdheim preached became more and more
deserted, the synagogue in which Sachs officiated
became more crowded week after week.</p>

<p>As Sachs performed great services in elevating
and strengthening Jewish self-respect, so also he
promoted Jewish knowledge. His contributions to
the latter touch the form rather than the essence.
In fact, he merely popularized Jewish subjects, and
rendered them accessible to educated Christians.
Sachs did not indeed promulgate novel, epoch-making
truths, or discover new facts. Nor was he a
poetical artist who could create brilliant pictures of
ideal worlds. There was more poetry in his life
and teachings than in his verses. His refined perceptions
enabled him to recognize and reproduce
the slightest shades in the beauties which other
artists had created, and he idealized what other inquirers
had discovered. The most decided bent of
his intellect was towards the exegetical interpretation
of Holy Writ. His fervent love of Judaism
and its ancient scriptures, his profound knowledge
of Hebrew, which was the language of his heart,
and finally his delicate √¶sthetic feeling for philology,
were all displayed in his exegetical work. Early in
life Sachs conceived the idea, to which he ever remained
true, of restoring to the Hebrew Scriptures
their pure and original sense, and freeing them
from all accretions and blemishes. Inspired by the
example of R√ºckert, "the poet of the East and West,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_693" id="Page_693">693</a></span>
the learned master in translation and exposition,"
he commenced with the Psalms, which might have
been the outpourings of his own pious heart. Afterwards,
assisted by various fellow-workers, Sachs
translated several books of Holy Scripture in an
admirable style to form a "Bible for Israelites."
But as he worked more with his heart than his
brain, his biblical exegesis was wanting in a firm
basis. The task of opening up new paths in this
direction fell to the lot of Christian scholars.</p>

<p>Sachs took an active part in excavating the
buried figures of the Jewish past, cleansing them
from disfiguring incrustations, and placing them
in their proper light. Three periodicals were particularly
devoted to this purpose&mdash;the "Kerem
Chemed" and the "Zion" in Hebrew, and the
"Orient" in German. Young and old assisted in
erecting a Jewish temple of fame, and contributions
flowed in from all parts of Europe. The "forties"
were especially prolific in the cultivation of Jewish
science. It was not pedantic scholarship, but their
heart that urged Jewish authors to bring forward
clear proof that Judaism, in all its ramifications,
went hand in hand with civilization. The Jud√¶o-Spanish
epoch exercised special attraction upon
Jewish inquirers. It showed what the Jews had
accomplished, and could accomplish in wealth of
thought and beauty of form. Jewish science at the
same time was to serve as an apology to the detractors
of Jews and Judaism, and as an ideal for arousing
emulation. The brilliant Spanish epoch was
known to Jewish scholars alone, and to them only in
rough fragments. Sachs undertook to reconstruct
from these fragments an organic, beautiful whole,
and by his eloquent language to attract those who
had no religious interest in the subject. His
"Religious Poetry of the Jews in Spain" (1845)
offers more than the title indicates. Sachs attractively
describes the series of the products of Jewish<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_694" id="Page_694">694</a></span>
genius, from the time "when in terrible agony the
limbs were torn from the living body," after the
destruction of the Jewish center by the Romans,
until the flourishing period of neo-Hebraic poetry in
Spain. The attention of the cultured world was
directed by Sachs' work to the wealth and beauty
of Jewish literature in the Middle Ages, of which
hitherto it had had no suspicion; even Heine was
seized with admiration, and employed his golden
pen in its cause.</p>

<p>At the same time the literature of the medi√¶val
Jews in France and Germany, and of the Jewish
poets of Provence was treated with copious detail,
but in a style fitted for a learned audience. Zunz,
the author of this work, justly rebuked his contemporaries
for their contemptuous neglect of this
branch of literature, to which Christian students of
the sixteenth and seventeenth centuries had devoted
so much attention.</p>

<p>Continuous devotion to the literature of the
Middle Ages threatened to become too one-sided.
That epoch, with its productions, was after all only
the offspring of the national activity of bygone days,
and the grandchild or great-grandchild of a still
more important period. This obscure question, the
dual origin of Judaism, from the Bible and the Talmud,
was clearly illumined by the light of investigation
through Jewish science in the "forties." The
Talmud lay under a ban, and was treated with most
offensive contempt. It was the scapegoat upon
which all the guilt and misery of the Jews were laid.
Like a leper it was shunned by respectable investigators.
But this did not last; the question was
raised whether the very writings which had served
as the basis for Christianity had not been inter-penetrated
with Talmudic elements. The proof of
the affirmative answer to this question was boldly
undertaken by Frankel. Yet more important was
the fact that it was made apparent that the strong<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_695" id="Page_695">695</a></span>
side of the Talmud lies in its ideas of justice and
their development. The superiority of the Talmudic
penal code over the legislation of ancient
times was established. The result of a scientific
treatment of the Talmud was that Judaism had no
cause to be ashamed of it.</p>

<p>But Judaism, together with its followers, remained
an undecipherable hieroglyphic, a dark mystery,
which one century transmitted to the other unsolved,
so long as the "original rock from which it had been
hewn, the depths from which it had been hollowed"
continued to be unknown. Only a thorough knowledge
of its primary sources, its sacred scriptures,
could supply the key to this riddle. Centuries had
elapsed, and the solution was not yet found. After
Holy Writ, the mother of two or three religions,
had so long been deified by the masses that it was
regarded as "the all in all," and its explanations of
life, nature, and history had been eagerly accepted,
it had fallen into contempt since the middle of the
eighteenth century. It shared the fate of the Jewish
race. The rationalistic school indeed paid a
good deal of attention to Hebrew sources, but only
with the intention of diminishing their value. Eichhorn,
Gesenius, Von Bohlen, De Wette, and Tuch
were filled with antipathy to the Jews, and were
thereby hindered from arriving at a correct understanding
of the Old Testament. The clericals
Tholuck and Hengstenberg sought vainglory therein,
and what they discovered they claimed for Christianity.
In Jewish circles there were only three men
who occupied themselves in a scientific manner with
the exposition of the Scriptures, namely, Krochmal,
Luzzatto, and Sachs; but they were timid, they
feared pressing too close to the borders of Sinai.
A man of childlike mind was the first to raise the
veil, to comprehend the language of the Prophets
and Psalmists, and to reveal the ancient history of
the Jewish people in its true light. With the appearance<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_696" id="Page_696">696</a></span>
of "The Prophets of the Old Testament," and
"The History of the People of Israel" (1843&ndash;1847)
by Heinrich Ewald, a new path was opened up for
the comprehension of the Hebrew genius and people.
The riddle so long obscured approached its
solution by the discovery of the key.</p>

<blockquote>

<p>"The nations of antiquity, the Babylonians, Indians, Egyptians,
Ph&oelig;nicians, Greeks, and Romans, each under favorable circumstances,
pursued only one particular object, till at length they reached
an eminence not attained by later generations.... The people
of Israel, on the other hand, from the beginning of its historical consciousness,
has so clearly kept in view its ultimate goal, and so
strongly striven to attain it, that it could not lose it from sight for any
length of time, and after any momentary pause it pursued it only the
more perseveringly. Its goal is perfect religion.... The history
of this ancient people is the history of true religion showing
every stage of development up to perfection."</p></blockquote>

<p>This new promising school has, as its fundamental
idea, that the race which owed its origin to the seed
of Abraham is actually and truly a "people of God,"
that has given the world truths of salvation in abundance.
The unfolding of these truths is manifested
in the course of the history and in the literature of
the Israelites. It is certainly a grave error of this
school, the first to unravel the artistic web, to imagine
that the last page of the history of God's people
was written eighteen centuries ago, and that
since that period it has only led a shadowy existence.
Great memories bring about resurrections,
and what people has a grander or more brilliant
past than the Jewish, or Israelite, or Hebrew people?
But if this people is still to accomplish work
in the world's history, its chains must be removed,
not only those which weigh down the limbs, but also
those which confine the mind. The nation had to
be freed, only then was it possible to find out
whether it would continue an independent existence,
or whether it would succumb in the conflict of
races.</p>

<p>Unexpectedly the hour of freedom for the European
Jews dawned with the revolutions of February<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_697" id="Page_697">697</a></span>
and March (1848) in Paris, Vienna, Berlin, in Italy,
and other countries. An intoxicating desire for
liberty came over the nations of Europe, more overpowering
and marvelous even than the movement
in 1830. With imperious demands the people confronted
their princes and rulers. Among the
demands was that of the emancipation of the Jews.
In all popular assemblies and proclamations, the
despised Jews of yesterday were admitted into the
bond of "Liberty, Equality, and Fraternity." What
the most sanguine had never ventured to hope for
suddenly took place. Jews were elected into parliaments
with a vote in the reconstruction of states.
A member of the Prussian Landtag had expressed
aversion to the idea that a Jew should one day
sit beside him, and be able to vote. The following
day it actually came to pass, for Riesser and Veit
took their seats next to this very man, in order to
consider the reconstruction of Germany, whilst
Mannheimer, together with Meisels, a rabbi of the
old school, clad in Polish garb, helped to reorganize
Austria. An assembly of Protestant clergymen
had declared that the conversion of a Christian to
Judaism was a sign of insanity or idiocy, but within
a short space of time, the laws were compelled to
concede freedom even to that creed.</p>

<p>During the stormy years of the Revolution and
those which followed, newly-established constitutions
in Germany were plentiful as blackberries. When,
however, the first panic of terror had passed away,
and the privileges of nations had become greatly
restricted, the emancipation of the Jews was nevertheless
taken as a matter of course (even in such
cases where a constitution had been forced upon
the people), as though this unqualified "Vox populi
vox dei" should not be in any way infringed.</p>

<p>It is probable that the partisans of the reaction,
as also their rulers, did not intend to realize those
paragraphs in the conditions, but the written words<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_698" id="Page_698">698</a></span>
had unexpectedly worked like a magic rune. On
England alone the storm-year had no effect. The
disabilities imposed upon the Jews of that country
were gradually put aside as occasion offered. Distinguished
personages were elected as aldermen
and sheriffs. But the last link in the chain, that of
opposition to their admission into Parliament, had
not yet been removed. When Baron Lionel de
Rothschild was elected as representative of the
City, in London, a Bill to confirm this election was
repeatedly presented (in the years 1847&ndash;51), but
after passing through the House of Commons with
a majority, it was each time thrown out by the
Peers. Although their opponents conceded that
the Jews were worthy of admission to Parliament,
they were excluded by the formulary of the prescribed
oath, "on the true faith of a Christian."
Great was the sensation created when David Salomons,
after having filled the office of Alderman, and
on being elected member for Greenwich, was daring
enough to enter the House, and on three occasions
to take part in the debates. For this conduct he
was fined ¬£1,500, being ¬£500 for each breach of
the law. The absurdity of such exclusion became
the more striking, when the High Court of Appeal
confirmed the heavy penalty (1852) as justifiable by
law.</p>

<p>From that time the Liberal party determined to
effect the abolition of the form of oath. As no prejudice
prevailed in England against the descendants
of the Patriarchs, but, on the contrary, a tendency
existed in their favor, it was to be foreseen that this
last limitation would also disappear. In fact, a few
years later a resolution was passed in the House of
Peers, that Jews should be admitted without taking
the prescribed oath, and this vote was immediately
approved by Queen Victoria (1858). Since that
time several Jews have occupied the post of Lord
Mayor, Baron Nathaniel M. de Rothschild has been<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_699" id="Page_699">699</a></span>
created a Peer, and the late Sir George Jessel,
Master of the Rolls.</p>

<p>Meanwhile Judaism has made marked progress in
another direction. A home for Jewish science was
founded in Breslau (1854). It was a matter of
pressing necessity, although the want was not universally
felt. The march of progress surprised
Judaism before the needful measures for remodeling
its religious life had been determined upon. Talmudical
schools, even in Russia and Hungary, had
collapsed for want of support. The rabbis were
useless in this emergency. Some who adhered to
the old forms found that the congregations no
longer appreciated their importance; others who
visited the universities chiefly studied Christian
theology, but were at a loss how to acquire Jewish
knowledge. This knowledge existed only in an
embryonic state. There certainly were various
learned periodicals, both in Hebrew and in modern
tongues, which treated of Jewish scientific subjects,
but these afforded only fragmentary information.
The teachers of Judaism needed first of all to learn,
what is Judaism? What justification is there for it
in the new phase of the world's history? They did
not know, and could only grope about blindly. They
were required to teach, and had not yet acquired
the rudiments of the subject. Their precious heritage,
the Scriptures, was not sufficiently prized, and
only a few specialists, Nachman Krochmal, Michael
Sachs, and Samuel David Luzzatto, occupied themselves
with this study, and even they threw light
only upon certain points. Jewish theological students,
unable to drink at the pure source of the word,
listened to Christian exponents, and were led
astray.</p>

<p>Jewish religious philosophy had still fewer representatives,
viz., Solomon Steinheim and Solomon
Munk. It is true that there existed a species of
theological seminary (which was recognized by the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_700" id="Page_700">700</a></span>
state) for French-Jewish students in Metz, and for
Italian-Jewish students in Padua, but the instruction
given was not based on scientific principles. It
was, therefore, an event of no mean importance
when a noble donor, Jonas Frankel, determined to
supply the necessary funds for establishing a Jewish
theological college. Fortunately, the undertaking
was organized by men who stood at the summit of
scientific knowledge&mdash;Zachariah <span class="locked">Frankel<a name="FNanchor_A" id="FNanchor_A" href="#Footnote_A" class="fnanchor">A</a></span> (died
1875), Jacob Bernays (died 1882), and Emanuel
Joel (died 1890). At first they were undecided as
to the plan of study to be pursued, and as to the
division of subjects, and the distinction to be made
between the chief branches and subsidiary matters,
and they realized the saying that "one learns by
teaching." In a comparatively short space of time
the chief posts in the more important communities
in Germany, Austria, and Hungary were occupied
by students from the Breslau College. So universally
was the necessity recognized of having schools,
that institutions for the study of Jewish theology
were founded in Buda-Pesth, Berlin (two), Amsterdam,
Cincinnati, and, in a modified form, in London.</p>

<div class="footnote">

<p><a name="Footnote_A" id="Footnote_A" href="#FNanchor_A" class="fnanchor">A</a> The author of this work was, together with Frankel, one of the
original founders. (Note by the Author.)</p></div>

<p>There is no more striking example of the transformation
effected in Judaism itself than by comparing
the various institutions, even those conducted
in the true orthodox spirit, with the Talmud Torah
schools (Beth ha-Midrash) in the Russian, and
some in the Hungarian communities. They contrast
with each other both internally and externally like
an architectural structure with a <span class="locked">mud-hut.<a name="FNanchor_B" id="FNanchor_B" href="#Footnote_B" class="fnanchor">B</a></span></p>

<div class="footnote">

<p><a name="Footnote_B" id="Footnote_B" href="#FNanchor_B" class="fnanchor">B</a> A Theological-Jewish Faculty, an offshoot of the University, and

<p>The occasional recurrence of persecutions against
the Jews awakened a feeling of brotherhood unexampled
in Jewish history since the separation of
Israel from Judah. The chief impulse to this feeling
arose from the action taken by Pope Pius IX.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_701" id="Page_701">701</a></span>
A Christian servant living at Bologna with a Jewish
family named Mortara secretly took a sick child
to be baptized. Some years later this fact came
under the cognizance of the priests. Thereupon
the boy Mortara, then six years old, was carried
away from his parents, by the officers of the papacy,
and placed in a monastery (1858). All steps taken
by the father to regain possession of his son were
useless. Equally fruitless were the efforts of various
governments and even of Emperor Napoleon III,
who protested against this act as one likely to injure
the papacy, if in the nineteenth century it countenanced
so barbarous a proceeding as the abduction
of a child. Pius IX at a former time had shown
liberal tendencies, but he afterwards revived the
narrow-minded course of action which prevailed in
the Middle Ages, and even commanded the Roman
Jews to be shut up within the dreary walls of the
Ghetto. Against all representations Pius IX obstinately
maintained his reply of "non-possumus."
The boy Mortara was kept hidden away, and brought
up in the ways of Catholicism; he eventually learned
to curse his parents and his race. But the papacy
reaped no advantage. The loss of Rome, or of the
so-called Papal States, followed soon.</p>

<p>This event and similar acts of intolerance induced
six noble young Frenchmen to establish a sort of
brotherhood for bringing help to those of their
co-religionists who were oppressed and suffering.
By their united efforts they endeavored to ameliorate
the condition of Jews who lived under intolerant
rulers, and to spread the advantages of education
amongst those in need of it. These men were
Aristides Astruc, collaborator to the chief rabbi of
Paris; Isidore Cohn, professor of the rabbinical
college; Jules Caballo, engineer; Narcisse L√©ven,
lawyer; Eugene Masuel, professor at the University
of Paris; and Charles Netter, merchant, only two
of whom (Astruc and L√©ven) are still living. They<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_702" id="Page_702">702</a></span>
founded an institution which bears the title of the
"Alliance Isra√©lite Universelle" (1860), having as
its motto, "All Israelites are responsible the one
for the other." This institution met with a cordial
reception, and members joined from all parts of the
globe. The accessions continued to increase, especially
after Adolf Cr√©mieux became president, and
in 1873 the number of subscribers had attained the
high figure of 12,526.</p>

<p>In the United States, where in the year 1775&ndash;6, after
the War of Independence, the republican form of government
was adopted, the equality of the Jews was
established as a matter of course. At first there
were only a few Jewish immigrants in New York
and Newport, but owing to the facilities offered to
all industrial pursuits and every species of commercial
activity, the number of American Jews rapidly
increased. They also formed themselves into a
body for the protection of their less favored brethren,
under the title of the "Union of American Hebrew
Congregations." They earnestly desired to promote
the welfare of the Jewish communities, built numerous
synagogues, and still continue to take a lively
interest in all that concerns their brethren in Europe.
In the year 1878 the Jewish-American population
numbered about 250,000 souls, and maintained 278
synagogues. In these places of worship the reform
ritual is chiefly followed. There being no communal
traditions to abolish, the changes which in Europe
could be brought about only after severe struggles,
were easily introduced. Even so radical a reform
as that of transferring the divine service from
the Sabbath to Sunday, which had been originated
by the insignificant Reform Congregation in
Berlin, was copied in various American congregations.
The warm sympathy displayed towards
Judaism and the Jews by the Americans is to be
highly commended, and to such sympathy the Union
owed its origin.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_703" id="Page_703">703</a></span>
The English Jews, to whom the task of leading
their brethren seems to have been allotted, were not
backward in uniting for the promotion of the well-being
of their race. At the instigation of two excellent
men, Abraham Benisch, editor of the "Jewish
Chronicle" (died 1878), and Albert L√∂wy, one of
the ministers of the Reform Congregation in London
(whose unassuming character would be wounded
were he to be praised according to his deserts), an
institution was founded (1871) in connection with
the Alliance Isra√©lite, and was called the "Anglo-Jewish
Association." Although the number of
English Jews is comparatively small (about forty
thousand in London and barely thirty thousand in
other towns and the Colonies), yet the members of
the Association number four thousand. Active
correspondence is maintained through its members
between Australia, Canada, India, Gibraltar, and
the parent body.</p>

<p>In Vienna, also, through the efforts of Joseph
Wertheimer, Ignatz Kuranda, and Moritz Goldschmidt,
an association was established under the
name of the "Israelitische Allianz." Their main
object was to work hand in hand with the "Alliance,"
but the primary task undertaken by them was to
promote an improved condition of affairs amongst
the Jews of Galicia. The Jews living in this province
of Austria, who number about one million, are for
the greater part in the lowest stage of culture.
Owing to poverty and the heavy labor required to
cultivate so barren a soil, they hardly made further
progress than enables them to learn their prayers.
Even those who possess the necessary ability and
leisure to acquire European culture are kept back
by the perversions of Neo-Chassidism, which possesses
many followers amongst them. To raise
them from their degraded condition is the praiseworthy
object of the Viennese Alliance. The
Alliance counts about five thousand members.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_704" id="Page_704">704</a></span>
This union amongst the flower of Judaism for
common action, besides its civilizing tendency, has
also a defensive purpose, for the prevention of
detraction and degradation. It could not, however,
have been foreseen at the outset, that so wide a
scope would have been presented for the work
undertaken.</p>

<p>After the Jews had been emancipated in Western
Europe, as they were in America, they labored
unceasingly at their own improvement, and could
soon point out distinguished co-religionists in the
highest ranks in every profession&mdash;crown lawyers,
councilors of state, members of Parliament, musicians,
authors, academicians, and in France even
generals.</p>

<p>The Jews of Western Europe became so amalgamated
with their surroundings, that timid minds
began to fear that Israel might be submerged in the
current. But suddenly they were confronted by a
bitter enemy who endeavored to exclude and oust
them from the positions to which they had attained.
This enemy all but challenged them to recall their
past, prove their own value in opposition to their
detractors, and show that though they are a peculiar
people, this peculiarity is as much an agent in the
world's history, as a product of it. This enemy, the
bitterest Anti-Semitism, the offspring of delusion
and falsehood, robs rejuvenated Israel of its peace,
plays an active part in the immediate present, and
unfortunately cannot as yet be relegated to the
domains of History.</p>

<h2><a name="RETROSPECT" id="RETROSPECT">RETROSPECT.</a></h2>

<p>The history of a people has here been narrated,
which, dating from prim√¶val times, continues to
possess all the vitality necessary for its continued
existence. Having entered the arena of history
more than three thousand years ago, it shows no
desire to depart therefrom.</p>

<p>This people, then, is both old and young. In its
features the traces of hoary age remain indelibly
impressed; and yet these very features are fresh
and youthful, as if they were but of recent development.
A nation, a relic of ages immemorial, which
has witnessed the rise and decay of the most ancient
empires, and which still continues to hold its place
in the present day, deserves, for this fact alone, the
closest attention. It must be borne in mind that
the subjects of this History&mdash;the Hebrews, Israelites,
or Jews&mdash;did not spend their existence in
seclusion and contemplative isolation. Far from it!
During all epochs they were dragged along in the
fierce whirl of passing events. They struggled
much, and suffered severely. The life of the people
during more than three thousand years received
many shocks and injuries. It still bears the trace
of its many wounds, while no one can deny its right
to the crown of martyrdom; and nevertheless it
lives to the present day! It has accomplished
much useful work, a fact that is gainsaid by none
except pessimists and malignant cavilers. Had it
only succeeded in disillusioning the cultured portion
of mankind from those deceptions of idolatry
which end in moral and social corruption, it would
deserve special attention for this alone; but it has
rendered far greater services to the human race.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_706" id="Page_706">706</a></span>
Whence came the high culture, on which the
enlightened modern nations pride themselves?
Surely they themselves have not originated it.
They are simply the fortunate heirs of an ancient
heritage, which they have turned to good account
and have augmented.</p>

<p>There were but two nations of creative mind who
originated this culture and raised humanity from the
slough of barbarity and savagery. These two were
the Hellenic and the Israelite people. There was
no third race of coadjutors. The Romans, indeed,
introduced and transmitted far-reaching social rules
and a high degree of military science; but only
when they had attained to a servile stage did they
perform services comparable to those of the insect,
which carries the fertilizing pollen to the receptive
stigma. The Greeks and the Hebrews were the
sole originators of a higher culture. If the modern
Roman, German, and Sclavonic nations, both on
this side and on the other side of the ocean, could
be despoiled of what they received from the Greeks
and the Israelites, they would be utterly destitute.
This idea, however, is a mere fancy; the nations
can no longer be deprived of what they once borrowed,
and what has since then become welded into
their very nature. The participation of the Greeks
in the regeneration of civilized races is conceded
without a dissenting voice and without a suspicion
of envy. It is freely admitted that the Greeks
scattered abroad the budding blossoms of art, and
the ripe fruits of a higher intelligence; that they
opened up the domain of the beautiful, and diffused
the brightness of Olympic ideas. It is also acknowledged
that their intellectual genius found its
embodiment in their whole literature, and that from
this literature and the surviving relics of their ideals
in the fine arts, there still issues forth new life-giving
energy. These classical Greeks are now long
dead, and to the departed, after-comers are prone<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_707" id="Page_707">707</a></span>
to be just. Jaundiced malignity and hatred are
silent at the grave of the illustrious man; his merits
as enumerated there are, in fact, as a rule overrated.</p>

<p>Now this aspect differs in the case of the other
creative race. Just because of their continued
existence, the merits and moral attainments of the
Hebrews are not generally acknowledged, or are
subjected to cavil&mdash;their qualities are depreciated
under wrong designations, with the view of blackening
their original character, or of denying altogether
the efficacy of that character, and, although
candid thinkers admit that the Hebrews introduced
the monotheistic principle amongst the nations, and
a superior code of morality, yet there are but few
who appreciate the wide bearing of these admissions.
Even deep thinkers do not carefully consider
how it came to pass that the one nation died
out notwithstanding its dominant master minds and
its rich talents, while the other nation, so often near
unto death, still continues to exist in the world of
man, and has even succeeded in regaining its pristine
youthfulness. Notwithstanding the fascination
of the mythology of the Greeks, the loveliness of their
productions in art, and their vivifying wisdom, these
qualities proved of no avail in the troublous days
when the Macedonian phalanxes and the Roman
legions, instead of allowing them to behold the
joyous side of life, caused them to experience the
seamy side. Then they despaired of their bright
Olympus, and at best only retained sufficient courage
to resort to suicide. In misfortune a nation displays
characteristics similar to those of the individual.
The Greeks were not gifted with the power
of living down their evil fortune, or of remaining
true to themselves when dispossessed of their territories;
and whether in a foreign country or in their
own land they lost their mental balance, and became
merged in the medley of barbaric nations. What
caused this total collapse? There was a potent<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_708" id="Page_708">708</a></span>
reason for the extinction of the Romans, the mightiest
nation of the ancient world, and likewise a reason
for the extinction of their various powerful predecessors,
for all of them relied too much on the
sword. Even among nations this law of retribution
holds good, "He who relies on the sword becomes
the prey of the sword." But how was it that the
Greeks succumbed to an analogous fate? The
answer is, that they had no decided and clearly
defined mission. The Hebrew people, on the other
hand, had to fulfill the life-task by which it was held
together, and by which in direst misfortune it was
comforted and preserved. A nation cognizant of
its mission, becomes strong and consolidated, and
forbears to spend its existence in futile dreaming
and scheming. From a national standpoint it was
the mission of the Israelites to work out their self-discipline,
to overcome or regulate their selfish
desires, to gain the full force of resignation, or, to
use the words of the prophet, "to circumcise the
heart." Abstinence, regarded from a religious
standpoint, induced them to exercise self-restraint,
and was combined with duties which sustained the
health of body and soul. The history of humanity
bears evidence to this. All the nations that polluted
themselves by profligacy, and grew callous through
violence, were doomed to destruction. Not so with
the Israelite race. In the midst of a debauched and
sinful world and amid vices with which, in its beginnings,
the Jews were also infected, they yet freed
themselves, they raised on high an exalted standard
of moral purity, and thus formed a striking contrast
to other nations.</p>

<p>The practical theory of life amongst ancient
nations was intimately connected with their conception
of the Divine; the one implied the other.
Was their perverted morality the result of perverted
theology, or its original cause? Whatever may
have been the relationship between cause and effect,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_709" id="Page_709">709</a></span>
the injurious consequences remained the same.
Polytheism, however poetically described, produces
discord, passion, and hate. In a council of gods,
there must be strife. Even when the objects of
worship are of a dual nature, the result is an inimical
contrast&mdash;one god of creation and one of destruction,
one god of light and one of darkness. The
creative divinity is usually divided into two sexes,
and is endowed with all the frailties of sex. Although
it has been said that man formed his gods according
to his own image, yet when theology was once systematized,
morality was demanded from the worshipers
of the gods, who nevertheless became as
sinful as the images which they adored. The people
of Israel proclaimed a God at one with Himself, and
unchangeable; a holy God, who requires holiness
from mankind, the Creator of heaven and earth, of
light and darkness. He, though mighty and exalted,
is yet near to humanity, especially protecting the
poor and the oppressed, a jealous but not a vengeful
God, to whom the moral conduct of man is not a
matter of indifference, although he is a God of
mercy, and regards all mankind with love as the
work of His hands. To this God evil is an abomination,
for He is a God of justice, a Father to the
orphan, and a Defender of the widow. These
words of world-wide import penetrated deep into
the heart of man, and, at a later period, were the
means of hurling the beautiful gods of the heathen
into the dust.</p>

<p>The thought and desire that men should be equal
before the law as before God, that the stranger
should have equal rights with the native, also grew
from the idea of man's resemblance to the divine
image, and became established amongst the Israelites
as a fundamental law of the state. This was
the first recognition of the rights of man, for, among
the nations of old, even the leaders of civilization
never conceded that right which has now become an<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_710" id="Page_710">710</a></span>
established rule. If a stranger, wrecked on a foreign
shore, was no longer offered up as a sacrifice,
as in the earliest times, he was nevertheless placed
under exceptional laws, and only considered to be a
degree higher than a slave. This harshness
towards the stranger, to the disgrace of nations,
actually survived the destruction of the ancient
world.</p>

<p>Israel's dominant idea became of far-reaching
importance in its ethical tendency. It is by no
means a matter of indifference in the moral conduct
of man, as regards both great and small things,
whether the earth, the scene of action, is governed
by one Power or by several mutually antagonistic
forces. The one conception ensures unity and
peace, the other unveils a picture of dissension and
discord, and leads to barbarism. The likeness of
man to God&mdash;in opposition to the blasphemous idea
of God's likeness to man&mdash;and the train of thought
arising from monotheism impresses man with self-respect
and with a regard for his fellow-man.
Thereby the life of even the humblest of men is
placed under religious and moral protection.</p>

<p>Is the abandonment of the new-born infant by its
parents a crime? Amongst the ancients, even
amongst the Greeks, it was not so regarded. The
mountains resounded with the wailings of female
children, and the rivers bore along the corpses of
the little creatures, whom their parents (finding it
inconvenient to rear them) had cast into the depths
of the streams without a pang or regret. The
ancients felt no prick of conscience at sighs of a
murdered infant, and still less would a tribunal of
justice demur at such crime. To kill a slave was
of no more consequence than to slay an animal in
the chase. Why, then, do cultured persons now
shudder at the idea of such misdeeds? Because
the people of Israel proclaimed the law, "Thou
shalt not kill, for in the image of God has man been<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_711" id="Page_711">711</a></span>
created. Thou shalt not take even a young life,
nor one whose existence is passed in servitude."
It has been asserted that man's intellect has made
giant strides, whilst his moral culture has remained
far behind, or has progressed but little since
prim√¶val times. But it must be remembered that
the barbarous state of man declined much later than
his ignorance.</p>

<p>Slumbering conscience and a repugnance to
crime was aroused only at a later period, and
this awakening was due to the people of Israel.
Still less did the ancient nations recognize chastity
of conduct, for they were sunk in the depths of vice
and unchastity. Whilst the nations were still at
the pinnacle of their greatness the Jewish Sybilline
poets repeatedly uttered warnings that the sinful
nations would be given over to death, because of
their unnatural vices, their atrocities, and perverted
worship, and the abominations which had ensued in
consequence.</p>

<p>But they only scoffed at the warning voice, continued
to pursue their evil ways, and were destroyed.
Their arts and their wisdom could not save them
from death. This shows that the Israelite nation
alone and solely effected the emancipation of man
by proclaiming holiness of life, the equal rights of
aliens and home-born, and all that is included in the
term humanity. It is not superfluous to point out
that the foundation-stone of culture, "Thou shalt
love thy neighbor as thyself," was laid by this people.
Who prayed that the poor might be raised
from the dust; the suffering, the orphan, and the
helpless from the dunghill? The Israelite people.
Who declared that everlasting peace was the holy
ideal of the future, "when one nation should no
longer draw sword against the other, and should no
longer learn the art of war"? Israel's prophets.
That people has been called a wandering mystery,
but it should rather be called a wandering revelation.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_712" id="Page_712">712</a></span>
It has revealed the secret of life, and the art
of all arts&mdash;how a nation may guard itself against
being given up to destruction.</p>

<p>This people cannot be charged with having introduced
self-mortification, self-torture, and a gloomy
view of life, and as having thus paved the way for
that monkish asceticism which covers the brightness
of life with the pall of death. Quite the contrary;
all the nations of antiquity except the Israelites
laid especial importance on death, made
immolations at the graves of the departed, and
gave themselves up to pious melancholy. These
were the mysteries which, like all exaggerations,
passed to an opposite extreme, and ended in the
excesses of orgies. The gods themselves did not
escape contact with death; they had to make a
death-journey, and here and there might be seen
the grave, or the Calvary, of some god. The
Israelite conception, which revered in God "the
source of life," places so much value on life, that it
seeks to banish from the circle of holiness all that
recalls death. So little is thought of what lies
within and beyond the grave, that the Israelites
have been reproached with having indulged in the
enjoyments of life. And this is true.</p>

<p>The prophets knew no higher ideal than that the
earth should be filled with the knowledge of God as
the sea covers its bed. Life is highly prized, but it
must be a pure and holy life. Only after a long
and unhappy course of history did a gloomy and
ascetic theory of life creep in, and produce a sad
and misanthropic order, which stamped out pure
gladness as a sin, and regarded the earth as a valley
of tears, and to this condition it actually became,
to some extent, reduced.</p>

<p>The Israelite people have nothing in common with
their kindred, who are called Semites, whether in
their self-torturing madness in honor of one god,
or in their dissipated excesses in honor of another<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_713" id="Page_713">713</a></span>
god. The Israelites were severed from the Semitic
tribes by hard discipline, and they weaned themselves
from the perversions of their alien kinsmen.
It is likewise erroneous to endeavor sophistically to
attribute the peculiarities of Israel to the Semitic
character, or to consider the relationship of the two
nations as that of two descendants from one stock.
The Israelites and other Orientals, through divergent
causes, are the result of a mixed union, and both
have lost many traits of their inherited nature.</p>

<p>The Israelites decidedly have great faults; they
have greatly erred, and have been severely punished
for their shortcomings. History describes and reveals
these errors, their origin, their eventful results,
and the consequences which resulted from them.
Many of these faults were acquired, and were to some
extent the effect of their surroundings; but there
were also peculiar and original features in the character
of this people. Why should they be more
perfect than all other nationalities, not one of which
has ever attained to perfection in all directions?</p>

<p>Those who eagerly endeavor to show the failings
and shortcomings of the Israelite people as through
a magnifying glass unconsciously pay them high
honor by making greater demands upon them
than upon other nations. It is a decided defect on
the part of the Israelites that they left behind neither
colossal buildings nor architectural memorials. Possibly
the race did not possess any talent for architecture;
or perhaps, owing to its ideals of equality,
the kings and warriors were not so highly esteemed
that it was considered necessary to erect in their
memory stupendous palaces, pyramids, or marble
monuments. The hovels of the poor ranked higher.
The Israelites did not even erect a temple to God
(Solomon's Temple being built by the Ph&oelig;nicians),
for the heart was God's temple. The Israelites
neither sculptured nor painted gods, for they did
not consider the Deity a subject for pleasant pastime,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_714" id="Page_714">714</a></span>
but gave Him pious and earnest devotion.
Nor did the Israelites excel in artistic epics, and
still less in drama or comedy. This may have
been a want in their idiosyncrasy, and is also
connected with their strong distaste for mythological
births and scandals. They evinced a similar
dislike to all dramas, public games, and theatrical
displays. However, in compensation, they had
poetical conceptions which adequately reflect the
ideals of life, as these are described in the Psalms
and in the poetically fashioned eloquence of the
prophets. Both possess this trait in common, that
their fundamental quality is truth and not fiction,
whereby poetry instead of being a mere toy and
plaything for the imagination, became the instrument
for attaining ethical culture.</p>

<p>Their literature, though it does not treat of the
drama, is yet full of dramatic vigor; and, if not
actually humorous, is nevertheless replete with
irony, and from its ideal pedestal proudly contemplates
all delusions. The Israelite prophets and
psalmists, whilst developing a beautiful poetic form,
never sacrificed the truth of the subject for the sake
of style. The Israelites also introduced a historical
style of their own, which pictured events according
to the canons of truth, and without any endeavor
to excuse or hide the shortcomings of heroes, kings,
or nations. This peculiar Hebrew literature, of
which no other nation on earth can show the like
(at best only an imitation), through its excellence
has achieved many moral conquests. The nations
capable of culture could not withstand the warmth
and truth which pervade these writings. If Greek
literature elevated the dominion of art and its perceptions,
Hebrew literature idealized the domain of
holiness and morality. The history of a nation which
has achieved so much has a decided right to full
appreciation.</p>

<p>Judged superficially, the course of history from<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_715" id="Page_715">715</a></span>
the entry of the Israelites into Canaan until far
into the times of the kings may easily give rise to
misconception, for the most striking events seem
to bear a political character. Invasions, battles,
and conquests, occupy the foreground of history.
We behold on the scene leaders of nations, heroes,
kings, and generals, treaties are made and broken,
whilst the prevailing intellectual activity is hardly
perceptible in the background. The hero-judges
who first form the subjects of history&mdash;Ehud,
Gideon, his son Abimelech, and especially Jephthah
and Samson&mdash;evince so few of the national characteristics
that they might equally well pass for
Canaanites, Philistines, or Moabites. Of Samson it
has been asserted that he is cast in the mould of the
Syrian Hercules. Most of the kings, and also their
sons and courtiers, acted as arbitrarily as if there
had been no code of law to set limits to their
despotic will, and as if they had never even heard
of the Ten Commandments of Sinai.</p>

<p>For centuries the people wore the bonds of wild
idolatry, and differed only in a slight degree from
the heathen world which surrounded it. Was the
race in its beginnings actually of no importance?
Did the people for a considerable time keep pace
with its Semitic kinsmen, and only at a given period
become stamped with those peculiarities which
caused it to contrast so strongly with its neighbors?
Did not Sinai illumine its very cradle? or was this
fact stated to have been the case only in after-days
and by historians? Sceptics have said as much,
but the fragments of Israelite poetry, dating from
prim√¶val times, give the lie to this assertion. Several
centuries before the inception of kingly rule,
and in the first days of the hero-judges, in the days
of Deborah, "the mother in Israel," a poet sang of
the marvels of the revelation; at Sinai he described
the people of God as contrasting strikingly with
their environment, and ascribed their lapses to the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_716" id="Page_716">716</a></span>
fact that they had followed "false gods," and thereby
fallen away from their widely different origin. Even
if one were inclined to doubt the veracity of history,
yet credence must be given to poetry as a trustworthy
eye-witness. It is not to be denied, that the
spiritual birth of the Israelite people was simultaneous
with their actual birth, and that Sinai was the
scene of the one event, as Egypt was of the other;
and that the Ark of the Covenant with the sacred
Ten Commandments was its faithful attendant from
the earliest days.</p>

<p>The nucleus of the people's faith in God and in
their mission, the fundamental doctrine graven on
the tablets of stone, were of hoary antiquity,
coeval with their representatives. Men especially
chosen, and having no connection with the work-a-day
actions and turmoil of the people, like the
Cherubim at Shiloh, were to shield the sanctuary.
This sanctuary only apparently bears a religious
stamp, is only apparently theocratic, but its essence
is contained in the laws of morality. God is the
origin of the doctrine, but not its end, which lies
rather in individual and communal life and its
legitimate demands.</p>

<p>In this law God is the Holy Will, determining
whatever is ethical and good. He is the sacred
Type which indicates the way, but not the cause for
which actions are to be performed, in order that
some definite advantage may accrue. The Israelite
creed is, therefore, by no means a dogmatic doctrine,
but one of duty. Though a law of deliverance,
it has no mystic admixture. But this religion
or law of redemption was certainly beyond the comprehension
of the people while yet in its infantine
stage, and the ideal which was intended to endow it
with significance and vitality remained for a long
time an enigma to the people. This enigma was
first solved by the prophets. A considerable period
elapsed even after the prophets had spoken<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_717" id="Page_717">717</a></span>
their burning words of fire, before the nation
became the guardian of the teachings heard at
Sinai, and before they erected a temple for it in
their own hearts.</p>

<p>But as soon as this maturity was attained, and the
"heart of stone had become a heart of flesh," as
soon as the prophetic body were able to dispense
with the intervention of the priesthood, they could
depart from the scene; they had become superfluous,
for the nation itself had attained to a complete
comprehension of its own being and its own
mission. History shows how this twofold transformation
was effected; how the family of a petty sheik
became the nucleus of a people; how this small
people was humiliated to the condition of a horde;
how this horde was trained to become a nation of
God through the law of self-sanctification and self-control;
and how these teachings, together with a
spiritual ideal of God, became breathed into it as
its soul.</p>

<p>This national soul likewise grew into the national
body, was developed and took the form of laws,
which, though they were not subjected to the fluctuations
of time, were yet suited to the occurrences
of the age. The transformation was effected only
amidst severe struggles; obstacles from within and
without had to be overcome, and errors and relapses
to be amended, before the nation's body could
become a fitting organ for the nation's soul. The
hidden things had to be revealed, the obscure to be
illumined, vague notions to be brought into the light
of certainty, before that ideal Israel (as foreshadowed
by the prophets in the far distance of time,
and which had been expressly distinguished by them
from Israel as it then existed with all its defects)
might become a "light unto the nations." Assuredly,
there is no second people now dwelling upon
the globe, or hidden within the stream of time,
which, like Israel, has carried with it a pre-ordained<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_718" id="Page_718">718</a></span>
law. This people not alone possessed such a law,
but also the full conviction that it existed only on
account of this law, and in order to be the exponent
of this law, and that its sole importance lay in
its vocation to announce the truths of salvation.
These were to be inculcated not by violence and
compulsion, but by example, by action, and by the
realization of those ideals which as a people the
Israelites were to proclaim.</p>

<p>The profound insight afforded by History has
proved that it was the mission of the Greeks to
bring to light the ideals of art and science, but the
Greeks themselves had no knowledge of this fact.</p>

<p>It was otherwise with the Israelites. Not only
was their task apportioned to them, but the revelation
was made to them that it was their task, and
that without it they were of no more significance
than "a drop in the pitcher, or a mote of dust in the
balance." Only on this account did the men of
God call the Israelites a chosen people. The fact
of being chosen imposed on the nation heavier and
more important responsibilities, and a greater
measure of duty; and when their mission, as the
exponents of a special and religious moral conception,
became clear to them, the people prized their
task beyond all things&mdash;more highly than their
fatherland and nationality, and even more than life
itself. And because they sacrificed themselves, the
idea which dominated them attained to enduring
existence and to immortality.</p>

<p>The Israelites were the first people who possessed
the courage of their own opinions, and who
risked all worldly goods for their convictions. They
proved that a propaganda-making truth can be
sealed only by the blood of its martyrs. The loyalty
of their convictions endowed them with steadfastness
and endurance. Their inner core cannot
have been utterly corrupt, seeing that they were
enabled to bid defiance to the destructive force of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_719" id="Page_719">719</a></span>
nearly four thousand years, and to a host of enemies.
The history of the Israelite nation in its
beginnings is of a decidedly changeful character.
Two distinct factors determined its elevation and
decadence, one physical, the other spiritual, one
political, the other ethical. Suddenly, there gushed
forth a spiritual current, strong and foaming like
the mountain spring which has been gradually
gathering whilst hidden from sight, and the existence
of which commenced only at the moment when
it issued from its rocky bed.</p>

<p>The appearance of gifted prophets and psalmists
from the days of Amos and Isaiah resembles, in its
force and fertilizing power, the outpouring of a
mountain spring. The prophets and psalmists who
sowed the seed of great and ever true thoughts in
a charming and attractive form, and who constitute
the flower of the Israelite people, could not have
arisen and carried out all that they actually
effected, unless the previous conditions had been
favorable to their purpose. They arose because
the soil had been spiritually fertilized for them,
and they were understood only because their
exalted moral theories of life did not announce anything
novel or strange to the people, but they
preached what was already well known, in impassioned
and poetically illumined words, and were
impelled by self-abnegation, zeal, and manly
courage.</p>

<p>Even those who do not believe in wonders must
admit and admire the marvelous course of Israel's
history. Is it not marvelous that just during the
untoward conditions of the Babylonian exile, in a
country "full of idols and license," and amongst a
Jud√¶an nobility who, untaught and unconverted by
their sad experience, continued their evil ways
during exile&mdash;that amid such surroundings a spiritual
movement could be developed which found vent
in a peculiarly characteristic manner? During the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_720" id="Page_720">720</a></span>
Babylonian exile the psalmists bewailed in touching
strains, and with poetic brilliance, their own sorrows
and the national misfortunes, and these strains
resound even to-day in the high-places of worship.</p>

<p>During this exile that magnificent didactic poem
in semi-dramatic form between the suffering Job and
his friends was composed, a poem consisting in
dialogues on human destiny and Divine Providence,
which is almost unrivaled. During this exile the
prophets once more addressed their deaf and blind
community in poetic strains. Amongst them was
that divinely-favored man, the second Isaiah, who
was called the "great unknown." His words of fire
pour forth with inimitable power, chastising like a
father, yet comforting like a mother, wounding as
with a lash, yet healing as with balm. This prophet
fully established the fundamental idea for the justification
of Israel's continued existence, that, by its
submission of martyrdom, it is destined to be the
servant of God, to become a light to all nations, and
to carry salvation to the ends of the earth. Is it less
marvelous that Cyrus accorded to the Babylonian
exiles the permission to return to their native land,
to cultivate the deserted country, to rebuild Jerusalem
and the Temple in honor of their God, and
again to enjoy a certain amount of independence?
Still more wonderful is it that prophets had predicted
with unqualified certainty the regeneration of
the nation in a single day, and that the exodus from
Egypt would be succeeded by an exodus from
Babylon. Even their prophecy that the heathen
would join the Jud√¶an people was fulfilled. Thus
the Jud√¶an nationality became resuscitated in their
own land, the people became filled with ancient recollections
and new hopes, and were determined to
realize the exhortations of the prophets. The people
preserved their independence in their own
country during six hundred years. The proneness
to idolatry, which, to a great extent, had been found<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_721" id="Page_721">721</a></span>
irresistible in the pre-exilic period, suddenly disappeared,
and with it also pagan customs and vices.
The Torah, as the law book, was to become the
guiding-line of the regenerated nation, whose "heart
of stone had been changed into a heart of flesh,"
and not only of the individual but of the whole community.
By periodically reading the Torah in the
Synagogue&mdash;a custom which was now introduced&mdash;and
by explaining it at least in one of the school-houses,
its teachings became the common property
of the higher classes. The Torah was the "Magna
Charta" of public life in the same way as the Jud√¶an
community developed into a species of "Civitas
Dei."</p>

<p>The prophets could now withdraw, for the law-givers&mdash;Pharisees
(Soferim)&mdash;relieved them of their
duties, and created a Synhedrion, which also possessed
a legislative function. Thus post-exilic history
received a form entirely different to that of
pre-exilic times. The tribunal of the Synhedrion
was filled with painful anxiety as to the rigid execution
of pentateuchal ordinances. The teachers
of the people desired to avoid the repetition of pre-exilic
conditions, of idolatry, intercourse with the
heathen, and the imitation of pagan customs. Entire
separation from the heathen world and total isolation
were the consequences. A similar state of
things was also maintained against the Samaritans,
who defiantly sought to obtain equal rights of citizenship
in the "Civitas Dei." This was denied to
them. As, however, they would not be prevented
from worshiping the God of Israel, they erected a
rival temple on Mount Gerizim. Thus there arose
the first semi-Jud√¶an sect, that of the Samaritans,
who assumed an inimical bearing towards Jerusalem.
This was one result of over-punctiliousness. The
other consequence was the result of the maxim,
"Make a fence round the law." Thereby everything
which had formerly been permissible, and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_722" id="Page_722">722</a></span>
which only touched on the fringe of what was forbidden,
was interdicted. The members of the
Synhedrion, or authorized teachers of the law, on
the ground of this maxim, added fresh decisions to
the pentateuchal laws. These new sopheric laws,
and the prevailing punctiliousness, did not prevent
the establishment of Jewish colonies in Alexandria,
Antioch, and other Greek centers which had been
founded by Alexander of Macedon and his successors.
The Jewish colony in Egypt built a special
Temple, that of Onias, which rivaled the sanctuary
at Jerusalem. There the law was first translated
into Greek, and in this language it was read in all
Greek-speaking countries. This was a turning-point
in the course of Jewish history, although,
owing to the practice of reading the law in Greek,
public mourning was instituted in Jerusalem. Judaism
from this cause became, to some extent, more
closely approximated to the pagan world, and the
accession of nations into the community of Abraham
was promoted. On the other hand, the Hellenizing
of Judaism brought the nation close upon the verge
of destruction, and exposed it to the persecution of
Antiochus Epiphanes, and also to apostasy. From
these troubles it was only delivered through the
revolt of the Maccabees, whose rising was the cause
of many martyrdoms.</p>

<p>These victories were followed by a retrograde
movement. The laws which the Hellenist apostates
had daringly broken, and on account of which so
many martyrs had fallen, even those laws which had
been superadded as a fence, were henceforth yet
more zealously and scrupulously practiced. Judaism
assumed an altered Pharisaic (<i>i.e.</i>, punctilious)
character. For a portion of the people, the over-scrupulous
(Assid√¶ans), even this was not sufficient.
They imagined that only by retirement from the
world could the laws be strictly followed, and therefore,
under the designation of Essenes, they separated<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_723" id="Page_723">723</a></span>
from the rest, and followed their particular
mode of thought and peculiar observances. The
more worldly, such as the warriors and statesmen,
offered sharp opposition to such asceticism, and
rejected the additional ordinances which were not
justified by the letter of the law. Hence arose the
division into Pharisees, Essenes, and Sadducees,
which was one of the results of the Maccab√¶an war.
Internal dissensions ensued, and facilitated the subjugation
of Jud√¶a by Pompey and the Roman legions,
and the political independence of the Jud√¶ans under
their own king, which had been maintained during
a century, now came to an end.</p>

<p>Unfortunately, the Romans appointed their prot√©g√©,
Herod, to be king, and he instilled his venomous
ideas into the hearts of the Patriarchs. In
order, to some extent, to shield the populace from the
alienation desired by the Herodians, the exclusive
laws, more particularly the ritual ordinances, were
made more stringent. This was the work of Hillel
and Shammai. Further, fanatical zeal was displayed
in commemorating the liberty which had been disgracefully
forfeited; this was the work of the founder
of the zealot party&mdash;Judah of Galilee&mdash;with whom
the Shammaites were to some extent connected.
The zealots incited the whole nation to wage fierce
war against the Roman conquerors of the world,
but their attempt ended in the destruction of the
community and of Jerusalem, and the greatly-revered
Temple was laid waste. It is, however, a marvelous
fact that the nationality and the religion did not
perish, but survived the destroyers, Vespasian, Titus,
and their successors, as they had survived Nebuchadnezzar
and his dynasty. The populace was rescued
through the law, which had become its very soul.
The Synhedrial school-house now became the center,
but the law had totally changed in aspect.</p>

<p>Masses of new religious enactments now overlaid
the law; fences, Synhedrial enactments, customs<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_724" id="Page_724">724</a></span>
dating from more ancient or from recent times,
which had been orally delivered, and had accumulated
to an immense extent. These oral Halachas,
as they were termed, ranked, if not higher than,
certainly equal with, the written laws.</p>

<p>The Sadduc√¶an opposition to these laws had
ceased; young Christendom, which had sprung
from the lap of Judaism, or, to speak more correctly,
from Essenism, enhanced the value of the
highly-prized and overrated laws, and was indifferent
to their origin. In contradistinction to the Jud√¶o-Christians,
who thought that they could merge the
old laws with the new faith, the apostle Paul created
the Pagan-Christian idea, which rejected every prescription
of the law as entrammeling, and proclaimed
evangelical liberty. This attack on the law, and the
mystic formulas evolved by the Gnostics from the
letters of Holy Writ, caused all that bordered upon
religious precepts to become more precious and to
be more rigidly observed in Jud√¶an circles.</p>

<p>The transmission of Halachic doctrines had been
endangered by the divergence of opinion between
the disciples of Hillel and of Shammai regarding their
scope, limits, justification, and applicability, and in
consequence of the fatal termination of the disastrous
war. Those teachers of the law who had survived
the catastrophe were the more eager to hand
down such laws, which they claimed to have transmitted
faithfully, and to rescue them from oblivion.
Youths and men, now rid of political cares, thronged
to the celebrated colleges in order to impress on
their memories the traditions handed down to them.
They vied with each other in teaching and learning.
But this eagerness did not crush out zealotism and
a desire to take up arms in the cause of freedom.
Fiery youths, especially the disciples of the school
of Akiba, quitted the school-house in order at an
opportune moment to carry on a bloody feud with
the Roman legions&mdash;in the first instance this<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_725" id="Page_725">725</a></span>
occurred under Trajan, scarcely half a century after
the fall of Jerusalem, and again two decades later
under Hadrian. These attempts ended disastrously;
Hadrian instituted a system of persecution directed
more against Judaism than against the Jud√¶ans,
and especially against teachers and disciples, in the
hope of destroying the Law, the very soul of the
nationality, but he did not succeed in his object.
The fiery zeal for the traditional law was increased
through the activity of Akiba's disciples, who had
returned from exile.</p>

<p>The center was, however, transferred to Galilee,
as Jud√¶a, the southern portion of the country, had
been laid waste, and was chiefly in the possession of
pagan colonists. Here was situated the Patriarchate
which represented the unity of the people, the post
of Patriarch being occupied by a descendant of
Hillel, who, as it was alleged, came from the royal
house of David, and who, from the tiny territory of
Galilee, from Sepphoris and Tiberias, governed the
numerous communities of the Diaspora&mdash;beyond the
land and the sea, in Egypt, Babylon, Asia Minor,
and Europe. His encyclicals, which were sent by
special messengers, were greeted with respect, and
were obeyed like those of a spiritual chief. The
Mishnah, the fundamental text of the voluminous
Talmud, a collection of Halachic laws, and species
of "corpus juris civilis canonici," which was compiled
by the Patriarch Judah I, owed its universal
recognition to that cause. This spiritual greatness,
however, was destroyed through Byzantium, from
the time that the Roman Empire worshiped, or was
compelled to worship, Jesus instead of Jupiter, and
the fanatical persecution practiced mutually amongst
the Christian sects was visited upon the Jews.</p>

<p>The Byzantine emperors, Constantine, Theodosius II,
and Justinian, treated the sons of Jacob
even more mercilessly than their heathen enemies.
They deprived them of their Roman rights of citizenship,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_726" id="Page_726">726</a></span>
of their rights as men, and also encroached
upon their freedom in religious practices. This
example was followed by the rulers in various European
countries, more especially in France and
Spain.</p>

<p>Fortunately, there had been formed a new center
in another quarter, on the banks of the Euphrates
and Tigris, where numerous Jud√¶an communities
occupied a favorable position, and lived almost in a
state of political independence, under their own
Jud√¶an prince, the Exilarch. The schools which
were here established replaced those which had
been destroyed in the Holy Land. These schools
exercised authority over the entire Jewish community,
with but few interruptions, during seven hundred
years. Here there arose the Babylonian Talmud,
which was more fortunate than its companion-work,
the Palestinian or Jerusalem Talmud, a
religious code of a peculiar kind. This work with
its phases of light and shade exercised an influence
in Jewish circles (which continues to the present
day), and it almost over-shadowed Holy Writ.
Here also Talmudical dialectics became developed,
and endowed the Jews who stood beneath the spell
of the Talmud with peculiar characteristics, especially
imbuing them with that love of hair-splitting
which afterwards deteriorated into sophistic subtlety.
The authority of the Talmud, however, was to some
extent lessened through events which occurred on
the Arabian Peninsula. Mahomet, the son of
Abdallah, from Mecca, had established the Islamite
religion on the basis of various fragments of Judaism.
The Arabs at first lived on friendly terms
with the Jud√¶ans who dwelt in their land, and who
were warlike, lovers of freedom and of song, and
superior to the Arabs by reason of their possession
of Holy Writ. Mahomet, however, having been
derided by them, afterwards waged war against one
Jud√¶an tribe after another, and exiled them from<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_727" id="Page_727">727</a></span>
Arabia, which proscription was upheld by Caliph
Omar.</p>

<p>The exiles settled in Palestine and Babylon, where
they became acquainted with tribesmen and co-religionists,
who, having followed the Talmudical precepts,
had acquired totally different habits. They
found the Talmudical restrictions incompatible with
their hereditary and unquenched thirst for liberty.
This Jud√¶o-Arabic circle declared war against Talmudism.
The contest, which in the first instance
was only of a mild character, the needful ability to
sustain it being wanting, afterwards became fiercer,
when Anan, a connection of the Prince of Captivity,
eagerly joined in the fray, asserting Holy Writ to
be the sole source of religion, and the Talmud to be
only the work of man.</p>

<p>Thus arose a new sect, the Ananites, or Karaites.
Although small in numbers, yet by their energy
and combativeness they aroused the less active
minds, and stimulated the desire for a knowledge
of Holy Writ, which had hitherto fallen into neglect.
The impulse given to this study was so powerful
that Saadiah, the representative of a Talmudical
school, devoted his entire attention to it. Through
him a philosophical tendency was introduced into
Jud√¶an circles. Until this time, as in Christendom
and Islam, a belief in existing authorities
had caused it to be considered heretical to speculate
upon religion.</p>

<p>From Babylon there now emanated a spark of
rational thought and scientific inquiry, which traveled
as far as the Pyrenean Peninsula. This territory,
being under Mahometan rule, was connected
in spirit with the East. A long succession of eminent
personages had during two centuries fostered
and cultivated a spirit of deep research in Spain,
whilst in Christendom a fanatical desire for persecution
resulted in the destruction of the Jews, or in
their banishment from the homes which they had<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_728" id="Page_728">728</a></span>
possessed for so long a time. The culminating
point of philosophical thought was attained by
Moses Maimuni, who for centuries was "the Guide
of the Perplexed," and who also, under the sanction
of the Church, exercised a powerful influence on
Dominican scholasticism. Where there is great
light there must also be much shadow. The shadows
caused by the light which had proceeded from
Maimuni became embodied in the vagaries of the
Kabbala, which confused the minds of the multitude
by its forgeries, and corrupted the feelings by its
excesses.</p>

<p>A deep gulf was created in Spain and Southern
France between the Maimunists and anti-Maimunists,
between faith based upon intellectuality,
and faith based upon authority. This schism would
have given rise to sectarianism, had not the accumulated
sufferings of the people riveted their attention
on what was proximate&mdash;the misery of all.
Faith in authority proved victorious, under the
influence of the Kabbala, and every scientific pursuit,
excepting that of medicine, was proscribed in Spain,
as if it were intended to undermine the continuance
of Judaism. The fourteenth century ignored the
tenth century. Solomon ben Adret, who had
solemnly pronounced an interdict against philosophy,
ranked Saadiah as to some extent a heretic. It
seemed as if, with the decay of knowledge, the
glory of the Spanish Jews were to be entirely
extinguished.</p>

<p>The cup of sorrow, drained by the Jews throughout
Central Europe&mdash;from the Rhine to the Vistula,
and from the Alps to the marsh-lands of the German
Ocean&mdash;in consequence of the Black Death, as
if they had indeed been poisoners, also reached
the Spanish Jews. Their grandees, who had been
employed at the court as ministers of finance, diplomatists,
private secretaries, or court physicians,
were powerless to protect them, as they had formerly
done.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_729" id="Page_729">729</a></span>
The horrible massacre in 1391 had driven many
Jews, with wild despair in their hearts, into the arms
of the Church, and they deceived themselves with
the idea that they could outwardly join the Church,
whilst remaining inwardly faithful to the God of
Israel.</p>

<p>Thus arose the Marranos. Their fanatical persecutors,
however, knew no peace until they had
succeeded in arousing the thunders of the Inquisition
against the Jews, in lighting the stake, in causing
them to be banished from Spain by hundreds of
thousands, and in enforcing compulsory baptism in
Portugal. But the Inquisition and the stake in both
of these countries only awoke a deeper love for
Judaism in the hearts of the Marranos. Great as
was the number of those who perished at the autos-da-f√©,
or who pined away in prison, yet their offspring,
who secretly continued to cherish their own
faith at the risk of their lives, after one or two centuries
sought to escape from the hell on the Pyrenean
Peninsula.</p>

<p>Under the guise of Spanish or Portuguese merchants,
they founded large communities in Bordeaux,
Amsterdam, London, and in various parts of Italy.
From their step-fatherland they brought with them
a higher culture and an aristocratic demeanor.
Consequently they did not suffer from the contempt
with which other Jews were treated in political and
social circles. In fact, the Jews of Marrano descent
looked down upon their co-religionists as gypsies,
on account of their external deterioration. With
marvelous rapidity, however, did those who were
considered as gypsies regenerate and elevate themselves;
and, what was more marvelous, this change
did not proceed from the aristocratic Sephardim.
The personage to whom this transformation was
due sprang from the midst of those who were so
despised and contemned. He bore no trace of
culture in his youth, but was deformed, awkward,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_730" id="Page_730">730</a></span>
and shy&mdash;this was Moses Mendelssohn, from the
petty community of Dessau. Had the call reached
him to become the leader of his co-religionists, he
would have replied, like the great Prophet in Egypt&mdash;"Who
am I?" It is remarkable that Mendelssohn,
without desiring or intending to do so, paved
the way for the emancipation of the Jews and the
purification of Judaism. The present age has given
the lie to the assertion of Jew-haters (who at the
close of the eighteenth century and commencement
of the nineteenth century were numberless), that
generation after generation must pass away before
any improvement could be expected in the debased
condition of the Jews.</p>

<p>In two decades there appeared on the canvas of
History a series of noble, if not of ennobled Jews,
in Germany, France, Holland, and Italy, and these
ranked as high as if they had been of equal birth
with Christians of the aristocratic class.</p>

<p>The historic course of the Israelite nation not
only shows, as with other nations, the stages of
growth, bloom, and decay, but it exhibits the extraordinary
phenomenon that the decay was succeeded,
on three different occasions, by a new budding and
blossoming time. The history of the crystallization
of the Israelite family group into a nation, and their
entry into the land of Canaan, until the establishment
of a kingdom, constitutes the growth. The
stage of bloom was in the days of the kings David
and Solomon, who raised the condition of the Israelite
people to that of a state of the first rank.
The period of blossoming was short, and was followed
by loss of power and by the downfall of the
nationality. But again it gradually revived under
the rule of the Persians and Greeks, developed
under the Maccabees, only to decay away under the
Romans. This decay, however, was merely superficial,
and was destined to give place to a resuscitation
in another form.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_731" id="Page_731">731</a></span>
One of the prophets has represented the growth
of the Israelite nation in Egypt by the picture
of a deserted female child left lying in the fields,
begrimed with blood and filth, but who, notwithstanding
her desertion and misery, develops into a
blooming maiden. The development of the race in
Babylon is described by another prophet under the
image of an unhappy and sorrowing widow, who has
been robbed of her children, until, on the unexpected
return of her numerous offspring from all ends and
corners of the earth, she is comforted, and regains
her lost youth with them. For the third rejuvenescence
of the Jewish race tradition has likewise
found a fitting picture.</p>

<p>At the gates of Rome there lies a human form,
clothed in rags, leprous, half dead, an object of horror
and pity. Suddenly this abject figure is touched
with a staff, on which biblical sentences are inscribed.
He rises, his hideous coverings and disfigurements
vanish, and he stands erect in the beautiful glow of
youth. Similes are but lame, and give no adequate
representation of a phenomenon to which there is no
equal in every-day existence. In any case, the Jewish
nation is an extraordinary phenomenon, dating
as it does from hoary antiquity, but possessing
youthful vigor, having passed through numberless
vicissitudes, yet remaining ever true to itself.</p>
